## Introduction

The [motivation](motivation.md) document has context on why we are looking at
static metaprogramming. This proposal introduces macros to Dart. A **macro
declaration** is a user-defined Dart class that implements one or more new
built-in macro interfaces. These interfaces allow the macro class to introspect
over parts of the program and then produce new declarations or modify
declarations. A **macro appplication** tells a Dart implementation to invoke the
given macro on the given code. We use the existing metadata annotation syntax to
apply macros. For example:

```dart
@myCoolMacro
class MyClass {}
```

Here, if `myCoolMacro` resolves to an instance of a class implementing one or
more of the macro interfaces, then the annotation is treated as an application
of the `myCoolMacro` macro to the class MyClass. The macro may then look at
the member declarations in the class, define new members, fill in method bodies,
etc.

You can think of macros as exposing functionality similar to existing [code
generation tools][codegen], but integrated more fully into the language.

**TODO: Describe scope and limitations of macros. What kinds of things they are
and are not allowed to do and why. Are there simple principles we can use to
define the boundary?**

## Ordering

A Dart program may contain a mixture of macros that introspect over portions of
the Dart program, macro applications that change that Dart program, and macros
are themselves implemented in Dart and thus potentially affected by changes
to the Dart code too. That raises a number of questions about how to compile and
apply macros in a well-defined way.

Our basic principles are:

1.  When possible, macro application order is *not* user-visible. Most macro
    applications are isolated from each other. This makes it easier for users to
    reason about them separately, and gives implementations freedom to evaluate
    (or re-evaluate) them in whatever order is most efficient.

1.  When users apply macros to the *same* portions of the program where the
    ordering does matter, they can easily control that ordering.

Here is how we resolve cases where ordering comes into play:

### Macro compilation order

Applying a macro involves executing the Dart code inside the body of the macro.
Obviously, that code must be type-checked and compiled before it can be run. To
ensure that the code defining the macro can be compiled before it's applied, we
have the following restrictions:

*   **A macro cannot be applied in the same library where it is defined.** The
    macro must always be defined in some other library that you import into the
    library where it is applied. This way, the library where the macro is
    defined can be compiled first.

*   **There must be no import path from the library where a macro is defined to
    any library where it is used.** Since the library applying the macro *must*
    import the definition, this is another way of saying that there can't be any
    cyclic imports (directly or indirectly) between the library where a macro is
    defined and any library where it is used. This ensures that we can reliably
    compile the library where the macro is defined first because it doesn't
    depend on any of the libraries using the macro.

**TODO: Instead of the above rules, we are considering a more formal notion of
"[modules]" or "library groups" to enforce this acyclicity.**

### Macro application order

Multiple macros may be applied to the same declaration, or to declarations that
contain one another. For example, you may apply two macros to the same class, or
to a class and a method in the same class. Since those macros may introspect
over the declaration as well as modify it, the order that those macros are
applied is potentially user-visible.

Fortunately, since they are all applied to the same textual piece of code, the
user can *control* that order. We use syntactic order to control application
order of macros:

*   **Macros are applied to inner declarations before outer ones.** Macros on
    class members are applied before macros on the class, macros on top-level
    declarations are applied before a macro on the entire library, etc.

*   **Macros applied to the same declaration are applied right to left.** For
    example:

    ```dart
    @third
    @second
    @first
    class C {}
    ```

    Here, the macros applied to C are run `first`, `second`, then `third`.

Otherwise, macros are constrained so that any other evaluation order is not user
visible. For example, if two macros applied to two methods in the same class,
there is no way for those macros to interfere with each other such that the
application order can be detected.

### Introspection of macro modifications

Imagine you have the following:

```dart
@serialize class Foo {
  Bar bar;
}

class Bar {
  @memoize int three() => 3;
}
```

The `@memoize` macro on Bar adds a field, `_memo`, to the surrounding class to
store the memoized value. The `@serialize` on Foo generates a `toJson()` method
that recursively serializes all of the fields on Foo. Since it does so
recursively, it would end up traversing into and introspecting on the fields of
Bar. When that happens, does the `@serialize` macro see the `_memo` field added
by `@memoize`? The answer depends on which macro runs first. But, since these
are unrelated macros on essentially unrelated declarations, that order shouldn't
be user visible.

Our solution to this is stratify macro application into phases. The
introspection API is restricted so that macros within a phase cannot see any
changes made by other macros in the same phase. The phases are described in
detail below.

### Complete macro application order

When all of these are put together, an idealized compilation and macro
application of a Dart program looks like this:

1.  For each library, ordered topologically by imports:

    1.  For each declaration, with nested declarations ordered first:

        1.  Apply each phase 1 macro to the declaration, from right to left.

    1.  At this point, all top level identifiers can be resolved.

    1.  For each declaration, with nested declarations ordered first:

        1.  Apply each phase 2 macro to the declaration, from right to left.

    1.  At this point, all declarations and their signatures exist. The library
        can be type checked.

    1.  For each declaration, with nested declarations ordered first:

        1.  Apply each phase 3 macro to the declaration, from right to left.

    1.  Now all macros have been applied, all imperative code exists, and the
        library can be completely compiled. Any macros defined in this library
        are ready to be used by later libraries.

## Macro phases

The basic idea is to build the program up in a series of steps. In each phase,
macros only have access to the parts of the program that are already complete,
and produce information for later phases. As the program is incrementally
"pinned down", later phases gain more introspective power, but have less power
to mutate the program.

A single macro class can participate in multiple phases by implementing more
than one of the macro phase interfaces. For example, a macro might declare a new
member in an early phase and then provide its implementation in a later phase.

There are three phases:

### Phase 1: Type macros

Here, macros contribute new types to the program&mdash;classes, typedefs, enums,
etc. This is the only phase where a macro can introduce a new visible name into
the top level scope.

Very little reflective power is provided in this phase. Since other macros
running in parallel may be declaring new types, we can't even assume that all
top-level identifiers can be resolved. You can see the names of types that are
referenced in the declaration the macro is applied to, but you can't ask if they
are a subtype of a known type, type hierarchies have not been resolved yet. Even
a type which could be resolved to an existing type might not actually resolve to
that type once macros are done (a new type could be introduced which shadows the
original one).

After this phase completes, all top-level names are declared. Subsequent phases
know exactly which type any named reference resolves to, and can ask questions
about subtype relations, etc.

### Phase 2: Declaration macros

In this phase, macros declare functions, variables, and members. "Declaring"
here means specifying the name and type signature, but not the body of a
function or initializer for a variable. In other words, macros in this phase
specify the declarative structure but no imperative code.

When applied to a class, a macro can introspect on all of the members of that
class and its superclasses, but they cannot introspect on the members of other
types.

### Phase 3: Definition macros

In the final phase, macros provide the imperative code to fill in abstract or
external members.

Macros in this phase can also wrap existing methods or constructors, by
injecting some code before and/or after those method bodies. These statements
share a scope with each other, but not with the original function body.

Phase three macros can add new supporting declarations to the surrounding
scope, but these are private to the macro generated code, and never show up in
introspection APIs.

These macros can fully introspect on any type reachable from the declarations
they annotate, including introspecting on members of classes, etc.

## APIs

The specific APIs for macros are being prototyped currently, and the docs are
hosted [here][docs].

### Macro API

Every macro is a user-defined class that implements one or more special macro
interfaces. Every macro interface is a subtype of a root [Macro][] type. There
are interfaces for each kind of declaration macros can be applied to — class,
function, etc. Then, for each of those, there is an interface for each macro
phase — type, declaration, and definition.

A single macro class can implement as many of these interfaces as it wants to.
This can allow a single macro to participate in multiple phases and to support
being applied to multiple kinds of declarations.

Here are some direct links to the root interfaces for each phase:

- [TypeMacro][]
- [DeclarationMacro][]
- [DefinitionMacro][]

As an example, the interface you should implement for a macro that runs on
classes in the declaration phase is [ClassDeclarationMacro][].

### Introspection API

The first argument to any method that you implement in your macro is the
introspection object. This is a representation of the declaration that the macro
was applied to.

For example, lets look at the [ClassDeclarationMacro][] API, which has the
following method that you must override:

```dart
class ClassDeclarationMacro implements DeclarationMacro {
  void visitClassDeclaration(
      ClassDeclaration declaration, ClassDeclarationBuilder builder);
}
```

The [ClassDeclaration][] instance you get here provides all the
introspective information to you that is available for classes in the
`declaration` phase.

The `builder` parameter also provides an api that allows you to retrieve an
introspection object for any `Type` object available to the macro at runtime.
The introspection capabilites of these objects are limited to the information
produced by the previous macro phase of macros, similar to the capabilites
provided for type references on the declaration.

### Code Building API

At the root of the API for generating code, are the [Code][] and `*Builder`
classes.

- The [Code][] class and its subtypes are first-class representations of
  pieces of Dart programs, essentially abstract syntax trees.
- The `*Builder` instance is always passed as the second argument to the methods
  you implement in your macro, and is what you use to actually augment the
  program with [Code][].

There is a different type of `*Builder` for each specific type of macro, for
instance if you look at the [DeclarationBuilder][] class, you will see this
interface method `void addToLibrary(Declaration declaration)`. The
[Declaration][] class here is a subtype of [Code][].

Most subtypes of [Code][] require fully syntactically valid code in order to
be constructed, but where you need to build up something in smaller pieces you
can use the [Fragment][] subtype. Any arbitrary String can be passed to this
class, allowing you to build up your code fragments however you like.

## Scoping

**TODO**: Fill in this section with more detail and a real proposal.

Macros will likely want to introduce references to identifiers that are not in
the scope of the library in which they are running, but are in the scope of the
macro itself.

We will want some way of providing an affordance to emit a reference to
something from the macro scope, but in the code generated for the original
library.

We do have the start of something like this already available in the `builder`
api - these have APIs to get a reference to a `Type` object. We will want to add
the ability to do the same for any arbitrary identifier, and then the ability
to emit references to these inside of [Code][] objects.

## Limitations

- Macros cannot be applied from within the same library cycle as they are
  defined.
  - **TODO**: Explain library cycles, and why they are a problem.
- Macros cannot write arbitrary files to disk, and read them in later. They
  can only generate code into the library where they are applied.
  - **TODO**: Full list of available `dart:` apis.
  - **TODO**: Design a safe api for read-only access to files.

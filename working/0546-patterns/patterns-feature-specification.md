(For comparison, the current #1 issue, [Data classes](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/314) has 824 👍.)

In particular, this proposal covers several coding styles and idioms users
would like to express:

### Multiple returns

Functions take not a single parameter but an entire parameter *list* because
you often want to pass multiple values in. Parameter lists give you a flexible,
ad hoc way of aggregating multiple values going into a function, but there is
no equally easy way to aggregate multiple values coming *out*. You're left with
having to create a class, which is verbose and couples any users of the API to
that specific class declaration. Or you pack the values into a List or Map and
end up losing type safety.

Records are sort of like "first class argument lists" and give you a natural
way to return multiple values:

```dart
(double, double) geoCode(String city) {
  var lat = // Calculate...
  var long = // Calculate...

  return (lat, long); // Wrap in record and return.
}
```

### Destructuring

Once you have a few values lumped into a record, you need a way to get them
back out. Record patterns in variable declarations let you *destructure* a
record value by accessing fields and binding the resulting values to new
variables:

```dart
var (lat, long) = geoCode('Aarhus');
print('Location lat:$lat, long:$long');
```

List and map patterns let you likewise destructure those respective collection
types (or any other class that implements `List` or `Map`):

```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var [a, b, c] = list;
print(a + b + c); // 6.

var map = {'first': 1, 'second': 2};
var {'first': a, 'second': b} = map;
print(a + b); // 3.
```

You can also destructure and assign to existing variables:

```dart
var (a, b) = ('left', right');
(b, a) = (a, b); // Swap!
print('$a $b'); // Prints "right left".
```

### Algebraic datatypes

You often have a family of related types and an operation that needs specific
behavior for each type. In an object-oriented language, the natural way to model
that is by implementing each operation as an instance method on its respective
type:

```dart
abstract class Shape {
  double calculateArea();
}

class Square implements Shape {
  final double length;
  Square(this.length);

  double calculateArea() => length * length;
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  final double radius;
  Circle(this.radius);

  double calculateArea() => math.pi * radius * radius;
}
```

Here, the `calculateArea()` operation is supported by all shapes by implementing
the method in each class. This works well for operations that feel closely tied
to the class, but it splits the behavior for the entire operation across many
classes and requires you to be able to add new instance methods to those
classes.

Some behavior is more naturally modeled with the operations for all types kept
together in a single function. Today, you can accomplish that using manual type
tests:

```dart
double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
  if (shape is Square) {
    return shape.length + shape.length;
  } else if (shape is Circle) {
    return math.pi * shape.radius * shape.radius;
  } else {
    throw ArgumentError("Unexpected shape.");
  }
}
```

This works, but is verbose and cumbersome. Functional languages like SML
naturally group operations together like this and use pattern matching over
algebraic datatypes to write these functions. Class hierarchies can already
essentially model an algebraic datatype. This proposal provides the pattern
matching constructs to make working with that style enjoyable:

```dart
double calculateArea(Shape shape) =>
  switch (shape) {
    case Square(length: var l) => l * l;
    case Circle(radius: var r) => math.pi * r * r;
  };
```

As you can see, it also adds an expression form for `switch`.

## Patterns

The core of this proposal is a new category of language construct called a
*pattern*. "Expression" and "statement" are both syntactic categories in the
grammar. Patterns form a third category. Like expressions and statements,
patterns are often composed of other subpatterns.

The basic ideas with patterns are:

*   Some can be tested against a value to determine if the pattern *matches* the
    value. If not, the pattern *refutes* the value. Other patterns, called
    *irrefutable* always match.

*   Some patterns, when they match, *destructure* the matched value by pulling
    data out of it. For example, a list pattern extracts elements from the list.
    A record pattern destructures fields from the record.

*   Variable patterns bind new variables to values that have been matched or
    destructured. The variables are in scope in a region of code that is only
    reachable when the pattern has matched.

This gives you a compact, composable notation that lets you determine if an
object has the form you expect, extract data from it, and then execute code only
when all of that is true.

Before introducing each pattern in detail, here is a summary with some examples:

| Kind | Examples |
| ---- |-------- |
| [Logical-or][logicalOrPattern] | `subpattern1 \| subpattern2` |
| [Logical-and][logicalAndPattern] | `subpattern1 & subpattern2` |
| [Relational][relationalPattern] | `== expression`<br>`< expression` |
| [Cast][castPattern] | `foo as String` |
| [Null-check][nullCheckPattern] | `subpattern?` |
| [Null-assert][nullAssertPattern] | `subpattern!` |
| [Constant][constantPattern] | `123`, `null`, `'string'`<br>`math.pi`, `SomeClass.constant`<br>`const Thing(1, 2)`, `const (1 + 2)` |
| [Variable][variablePattern] | `foo`, `var bar`, `String str`, `_`, `int _` |
| [Parenthesized][parenthesizedPattern] | `(subpattern)` |
| [List][listPattern] | `[subpattern1, subpattern2]` |
| [Map][mapPattern] | `{"key": subpattern1, someConst: subpattern2}` |
| [Record][recordPattern] | `(subpattern1, subpattern2)`<br>`(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)` |
| [Extractor][extractorPattern] | `SomeClass(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)` |

[logicalOrPattern]: #logical-or-pattern
[logicalAndPattern]: #logical-and-pattern
[relationalPattern]: #relational-pattern
[castPattern]: #cast-pattern
[nullCheckPattern]: #null-check-pattern
[nullAssertPattern]: #null-assert-pattern
[constantPattern]: #constant-pattern
[variablePattern]: #variable-pattern
[parenthesizedPattern]: #parenthesized-pattern
[listPattern]: #list-pattern
[mapPattern]: #map-pattern
[recordPattern]: #record-pattern
[extractorPattern]: #extractor-pattern

Here is the overall grammar for the different kinds of patterns:

```
pattern               ::= logicalOrPattern
patterns              ::= pattern ( ',' pattern )* ','?

logicalOrPattern      ::= logicalAndPattern ( '|' logicalOrPattern )?
logicalAndPattern     ::= relationalPattern ( '&' logicalAndPattern )?
relationalPattern     ::= ( equalityOperator | relationalOperator) relationalExpression
                        | unaryPattern

unaryPattern          ::= castPattern
                        | nullCheckPattern
                        | nullAssertPattern
                        | primaryPattern

primaryPattern        ::= constantPattern
                        | variablePattern
                        | parenthesizedPattern
                        | listPattern
                        | mapPattern
                        | recordPattern
                        | extractorPattern
```

As you can see, logical-or patterns (`|`) have the lowest precedence; then
logical-and patterns (`&`), then the postfix *unary patterns* cast (`as`),
null-check (`?`), and null-assert (`!`) patterns; followed by the remaining
highest precedence primary patterns.

The individual patterns are:

### Logical-or pattern

```
logicalOrPattern ::= logicalAndPattern ( '|' logicalOrPattern )?
```

A pair of patterns separated by `|` matches if either of the branches match.
This can be used in a switch expression or statement to have multiple cases
share a body:

```dart
var isPrimary = switch (color) {
  case Color.red | Color.yellow | Color.blue => true;
  default => false;
};
```

Even in switch statements, which allow multiple empty cases to share a single
body, a logical-or pattern can be useful when you want multiple patterns to
share a guard:

```dart
switch (shape) {
  case Square(size: var s) | Circle(size: var s) when s > 0:
    print('Non-empty symmetric shape');
  case Square() | Circle():
    print('Empty symmetric shape');
  default:
    print('Asymmetric shape');
}
```

A logical-or pattern does not have to appear at the top level of a pattern. It
can be nested inside a destructuring pattern:

```dart
switch (list) {
  // Matches a two-element list whose first element is 'a' or 'b':
  case ['a' | 'b', var c]):
}
```

A logical-or pattern may match even if one of its branches does not. That means
that any variables in the non-matching branch would not be initialized. To avoid
problems stemming from that, the following restrictions apply:

*   It is a compile-time error if one branch contains a variable pattern whose
    name or type does not exactly match a corresponding variable pattern in the
    other branch. These variable patterns can appear as subpatterns anywhere in
    each branch, but in total both branches must contain the same variables with
    the same types. This way, variables used inside the body covered by the
    pattern will always be initialized to a known type.

*   If the left branch matches, the right branch is not evaluated. This
    determines *which* value the variable gets if both branches would have
    matched. In that case, it will always be the value from the left branch.

### Logical-and pattern

```
logicalAndPattern ::= relationalPattern ( '&' logicalAndPattern )?
```

A pair of patterns separated by `&` matches only if *both* subpatterns match.
Unlike logical-or patterns, the variables defined in each branch must *not*
overlap, since the logical-and pattern only matches if both branches do and
the variables in both branches will be bound.

If the left branch does not match, the right branch is not evaluated. *This only
matters because patterns may invoke user-defined methods with visible side
effects.*

### Relational pattern

```
relationalPattern ::= ( equalityOperator | relationalOperator) relationalExpression
```

A relational pattern lets you compare the matched value to a given constant
using any of the equality or relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`,
and `>=`. The pattern matches when calling the appropriate operator on the
matched value with the constant as an argument returns `true`. It is a
compile-time error if `relationalExpression` is not a valid constant expression.

The comparison operators are useful for matching on numeric ranges, especially
when combined with `&`:

```dart
String asciiCharType(int char) {
  const space = 32;
  const zero = 48;
  const nine = 57;

  return switch (char) {
    case < space => 'control';
    case == space => 'space';
    case > space & < zero => 'punctuation';
    case >= zero & <= nine => 'digit';
    // Etc...
  }
}
```

### Cast pattern

```
castPattern ::= primaryPattern 'as' type
```

A cast pattern is similar to an extractor pattern in that it checks the matched
value against a given type. But where an extractor pattern is *refuted* if the
value doesn't have that type, a cast pattern *throws*. Like the null-assert
pattern, this lets you forcibly assert the expected type of some destructured
value.

This isn't useful as the outermost pattern in a declaration since you can always
move the `as` to the initializer expression, but when destructuring there is no
place in the initializer to insert the cast. This pattern lets you insert the
cast as values are being pulled out by the pattern:

```dart
(num, Object) record = (1, "s");
var (i as int, s as String) = record;
```

### Null-check pattern

```
nullCheckPattern ::= primaryPattern '?'
```

A null-check pattern matches if the value is not null, and then matches the
inner pattern against that same value. Because of how type inference flows
through patterns, this also provides a terse way to bind a variable whose type
is the non-nullable base type of the nullable value being matched:

```dart
String? maybeString = ...
switch (maybeString) {
  case var s?:
    // s has type non-nullable String here.
}
```

Using `?` to match a value that is *not* null seems counterintuitive. In truth,
I have not found an ideal syntax for this. The way I think about `?` is that it
describes the test it performs. Where a list pattern tests whether the value is
a list, a `?` tests whether the value is null. However, unlike other patterns,
it matches when the value is *not* null, because matching on null isn't
useful&mdash;you could always just use a `null` constant pattern for that.

Swift [uses the same syntax for a similar feature][swift null check].

[swift null check]: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#ID520

### Null-assert pattern

```
nullAssertPattern ::= primaryPattern '!'
```

A null-assert pattern is similar to a null-check pattern in that it permits
non-null values to flow through. But a null-assert *throws* if the matched
value is null. It lets you forcibly *assert* that you know a value shouldn't
be null, much like the corresponding `!` null-assert expression.

This lets you eliminate null in variable declarations where a refutable pattern
isn't allowed:

```dart
(int?, int?) position = ...

// We know if we get here that the coordinates should be present:
var (x!, y!) = position;
```

Or where you don't want null to be silently treated as a match failure, as in:

```dart
List<String?> row = ...

// If the first column is 'user', we expect to have a name after it.
switch (row) {
  case ['user', var name!]:
    // name is a non-nullable string here.
}
```

### Constant pattern

```
constantPattern ::= booleanLiteral
                  | nullLiteral
                  | numericLiteral
                  | stringLiteral
                  | identifier
                  | qualifiedName
                  | constObjectExpression
                  | 'const' typeArguments? '[' elements? ']'
                  | 'const' typeArguments? '{' elements? '}'
                  | 'const' '(' expression ')'
```

A constant pattern determines if the matched value is equal to the constant's
value. We don't allow all expressions here because many expression forms
syntactically overlap other kinds of patterns. We avoid ambiguity while
supporting terse forms of the most common constant expressions like so:

*   Simple "primitive" literals like Booleans and numbers are valid patterns
    since they aren't ambiguous.

*   Named constants are also allowed because they aren't ambiguous. That
    includes simple identifiers like `someConstant`, prefixed constants like
    `some_library.aConstant`, static constants on classes like
    `SomeClass.aConstant`, and prefixed static constants like
    `some_library.SomeClass.aConstant`. *Simple identifiers would be ambiguous
    with variable patterns that aren't marked with `var`, `final`, or a type,
    but unmarked variable patterns are only allowed in irrefutable contexts
    where constant patterns are prohibited.*

*   List literals are ambiguous with list patterns, so we only allow list
    literals explicitly marked `const`. Likewise with set and map literals
    versus map patterns.

*   Constructor calls are ambiguous with extractor patterns, so we require
    const constructor calls to be explicitly marked `const`.

*   Other constant expressions must be marked `const` and surrounded by
    parentheses. This avoids ambiguity with null-assert, logical-or, and
    logical-and patterns. It also makes future extensions to patterns and
    expressions less likely to collide.

Let the *value* of a constant pattern be the `expression` inside `'const' '('
expression ')'` or the entire pattern if the pattern has any other form. *This
awkward definition is because `const (1 + 2)` is not a valid expression but is a
valid constant pattern.*

It is a compile-time error if a constant pattern's value is not a valid constant
expression.

### Variable pattern

```
variablePattern ::= ( 'var' | 'final' | type )? identifier
```

A variable pattern binds the matched value to a new variable. These usually
occur as subpatterns of a destructuring pattern in order to capture a
destructured value.

```dart
var (a, b) = (1, 2);
```

Here, `a` and `b` are variable patterns and end up bound to `1` and `2`,
respectively.

The pattern may have a type annotation in order to only match values of the
specified type. If the type annotation is omitted, the variable's type is
inferred and the pattern matches all values.

```dart
switch (record) {
  case (int x, String s):
    print('First field is int $x and second is String $s.');
}
```

*There are some restrictions on when `var` and `final` can and can't be used.
They are specified later in the "Pattern context" section.*

#### Wildcards

If the variable's name is `_`, it doesn't bind any variable. This "wildcard"
name is useful as a placeholder in places where you need a subpattern in order
to destructure later positional values:

```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var [_, two, _] = list;
```

The `_` identifier can also be used with a type annotation when you want to test
a value's type but not bind the value to a name:

```dart
switch (record) {
  case (int _, String _):
    print('First field is int and second is String.');
}
```

### Parenthesized pattern

```
parenthesizedPattern ::= '(' pattern ')'
```

Like parenthesized expressions, parentheses in a pattern let you control pattern
precedence and insert a lower precedence pattern where a higher precedence one
is expected.

### List pattern

```
listPattern ::= typeArguments? '[' patterns? ']'
```

A list pattern matches an object that implements `List` and extracts elements by
position from it.

It is a compile-time error if `typeArguments` is present and has more than one
type argument.

**TODO: Allow a `...` element in order to match suffixes or ignore extra
elements. Allow capturing the rest in a variable.**

### Map pattern

```
mapPattern        ::= typeArguments? '{' mapPatternEntries? '}'
mapPatternEntries ::= mapPatternEntry ( ',' mapPatternEntry )* ','?
mapPatternEntry   ::= expression ':' pattern
```

A map pattern matches values that implement `Map` and accesses values by key
from it.

It is a compile-time error if:

*   `typeArguments` is present and there are more or fewer than two type
    arguments.

*   Any of the entry key expressions are not constant expressions.

*   If any two keys in the map both have primitive `==` methods, then it is a
    compile-time error if they are equal according to their `==` operator. *In
    cases where keys have types whose equality can be checked at compile time,
    we report errors if there are redundant keys. But we don't require the keys
    to have primitive equality for flexibility. In map patterns where the keys
    don't have primitive equality, it is possible to have redundant keys and the
    compiler won't detect it.*

### Record pattern

```
recordPattern         ::= '(' patternFields? ')'
patternFields         ::= patternField ( ',' patternField )* ','?
patternField          ::= ( identifier? ':' )? pattern
```

A record pattern matches a record object and destructures its fields. If the
value isn't a record with the same shape as the pattern, then the match fails.
Otherwise, the field subpatterns are matched against the corresponding fields in
the record.

Field subpatterns can be in one of three forms:

*   A bare `pattern` destructures the corresponding positional field from the
    record and matches it against `pattern`.

*   An `identifier: pattern` destructures the named field with the name
    `identifier` and matches it against `pattern`.

*   A `: pattern` is a named field with the name omitted. When destructuring
    named fields, it's very common to want to bind the resulting value to a
    variable with the same name.

    As a convenience, the identifier can be omitted and inferred from `pattern`.
    The subpattern must be a variable pattern which may be wrapped in a unary
    pattern. The field name is then inferred from the name in the variable
    pattern. These pairs of patterns are each equivalent:

    ```dart
    // Variable:
    var (untyped: untyped, typed: int typed) = ...
    var (:untyped, :int typed) = ...

    switch (obj) {
      case (untyped: var untyped, typed: int typed): ...
      case (:var untyped, :int typed): ...
    }

    // Null-check and null-assert:
    switch (obj) {
      case (checked: var checked?, asserted: var asserted!): ...
      case (:var checked?, :var asserted!): ...
    }

    // Cast:
    var (field: field as int) = ...
    var (:field as int) = ...
    ```

A record pattern with a single unnamed field and no trailing comma is ambiguous
with a parenthesized pattern. In that case, it is treated as a parenthesized
pattern. To write a record pattern that matches a single unnamed field, add a
trailing comma, as you would with the corresponding record expression.

### Extractor pattern

```
extractorPattern ::= extractorName typeArguments? '(' patternFields? ')'
extractorName    ::= typeIdentifier | qualifiedName
```

An extractor matches values of a given named type and then extracts values from
it by calling getters on the value. Extractor patterns let users destructure
data from arbitrary objects using the getters the object's class already
exposes.

This pattern is particularly useful for writing code in an algebraic datatype
style. For example:

```dart
class Rect {
  final double width, height;

  Rect(this.width, this.height);
}

display(Object obj) {
  switch (obj) {
    case Rect(width: var w, height: var h): print('Rect $w x $h');
    default: print(obj);
  }
}
```

It is a compile-time error if:

*   `extractorName` does not refer to a type.

*   A type argument list is present and does not match the arity of the type of
    `extractorName`.

*   A `patternField` is of the form `pattern`. Positional fields aren't allowed.

As with record patterns, the getter name can be omitted and inferred from the
variable pattern in the field subpattern which may be wrapped in a unary
pattern. The previous example could be written like:

```dart
display(Object obj) {
  switch (obj) {
    case Rect(:var width, :var height): print('Rect $width x $height');
    default: print(obj);
  }
}
```

## Pattern uses

Patterns are woven into the larger language in a few ways:

### Pattern variable declaration

Places in the language where a local variable can be declared are extended to
allow a pattern, like:

```dart
var (a, [b, c]) = ("str", [1, 2]);
```

Dart's existing C-style variable declaration syntax makes it harder to
incorporate patterns. Variables can be declared just by writing their type, and
a single declaration might declare multiple variables. Fully incorporating
patterns into that could lead to confusing syntax like:

```dart
// Not allowed:
(int, String) (n, s) = (1, "str");
final (a, b) = (1, 2), c = 3, (d, e);
```

To avoid this weirdness, patterns only occur in variable declarations that begin
with a `var` or `final` keyword. Also, a variable declaration using a pattern
can only have a single declaration "section". No comma-separated multiple
declarations like:

```dart
// Not allowed:
var [a] = [1], (b, c) = (2, 3);
```

Declarations with patterns must have an initializer. This is not a limitation
since the point of using a pattern in a variable declaration is to match it
against the initializer's value.

Add this new rule:

```
patternDeclaration  ::= ( 'final' | 'var' ) outerPattern '=' expression

outerPattern        ::= parenthesizedPattern
                      | listPattern
                      | mapPattern
                      | recordPattern
                      | extractorPattern
```

The `outerPattern` rule defines a subset of the patterns that are allowed as the
outermost pattern in a declaration. Subsetting allows useful code like:

```dart
var ((a, b) & record) = (1, 2);           // Parentheses.
var [a, b] = [1, 2];                      // List.
var {1: a} = {1: 2};                      // Map.
var (a, b, x: x) = (1, 2, x: 3);          // Record.
var Point(x: x, y: y) = Point(1, 2);      // Extractor.
```

But excludes other kinds of patterns to prohibit weird code like:

```dart
// Not allowed:
var String str = 'redundant';     // Variable.
var str as String = 'weird';      // Cast.
var definitely! = maybe;          // Null-assert.
```

Allowing parentheses gives users an escape hatch if they really want to use an
unusual pattern there.

**TODO: Should we support destructuring in `const` declarations?**

The new rules are incorporated into the existing productions for declaring
variables like so:

```
localVariableDeclaration ::=
  | initializedVariableDeclaration ';' // Existing.
  | patternDeclaration ';' // New.

forLoopParts ::=
  | // Existing productions...
  | ( 'final' | 'var' ) outerPattern 'in' expression // New.
```

As with regular for-in loops, it is a compile-time error if the type of
`expression` in a pattern-for-in loop is not assignable to `Iterable<dynamic>`.

*We could potentially allow patterns in top-level variables and static fields
but lazy initialization makes that more complex. We could support patterns in
instance field declarations, but constructor initializer lists make that harder.
Parameter lists are a natural place to allow patterns, but the existing grammar
complexity of parameter lists&mdash;optional parameters, named parameters,
required parameters, default values, etc.&mdash;make that very hard. For the
initial proposal, we focus on patterns only in variables with local scope.*

### Pattern assignment

A pattern on the left side of an assignment expression is used to destructure
the assigned value. We extend `expression`:

```
expression        ::= patternAssignment
                    | // Existing productions...

patternAssignment ::= outerPattern '=' expression
```

*This syntax allows chaining pattern assignments and mixing them with other
assignments, but does not allow patterns to the left of a compound assignment
operator.*

In a pattern assignment, all variable patterns are interpreted as referring to
existing variables. You can't declare any new variables. *Disallowing new
variables allows pattern assignment expressions to appear anywhere expressions
are allowed while avoiding confusion about the scope of new variables.*

It is a compile-time error if:

*   An identifier in a variable pattern does not resolve to a non-final local
    variable. *We could allow assigning to other variables or setters, but it
    seems strange to allow assigning to `foo` when `foo` is an instance field on
    the surrounding class with an implicit `this.`, but not allowing to assign
    to `this.foo` explicitly. In the future, we may expand pattern assignment
    syntax to allow other selector expressions. For now, we restrict assignment
    to local variables, which are also the only kind of variables that can be
    declared by patterns.*

*   The matched value type for a variable or cast pattern is not assignable to
    the corresponding variable's type.

*   The same variable is assigned more than once. *In other words, a pattern
    assignment can't have multiple variable subpatterns with the same name. This
    prohibits code like:*

    ```dart
    var a = 1;
    (a & a) = 2;
    [a, a, a] = [1, 2, 3];
    ```

### Switch statement

We extend switch statements to allow patterns in cases:

```
switchStatement ::= 'switch' '(' expression ')' '{' switchCase* defaultCase? '}'
switchCase      ::= label* caseHead ':' statements
caseHead        ::= 'case' pattern ( 'when' expression )?
```

Allowing patterns in cases significantly increases the expressiveness of what
properties a case can verify, including executing arbitrary user-defined code.
This implies that the order that cases are checked is now potentially
user-visible and an implementation must execute the *first* case that matches.

#### Breaking existing switches

Many constant expressions are subsumed by the new pattern syntax so most
existing switch cases have the same semantics under this proposal. However,
patterns are not a strict superset of constant expressions and some switches may
be broken.

To estimate how breaking these changes are, I analyzed 18,672,247 lines of code
in 102,015 files across 2,000 Pub packages, a large collection of open source
Flutter applications, and the Dart and Flutter repositories. I found a total of
94,249 switch cases.

The specific kinds of switches whose behavior changes are:

*   **List and map patterns.** A list or map constant literal in a switch case
    is now interpreted as a list or map *pattern* which destructures its
    elements at runtime. Before, it was simply treated as identity comparison.

    ```dart
    const a = 1;
    const b = 2;
    var obj = [1, 2]; // Not const.

    switch (obj) {
      case [a, b]: print("match"); break;
      default: print("no match");
    }
    ```

    In Dart today, this prints "no match". With this proposal, it changes to
    "match". I did not find any switch cases whose expression is a list or map
    literal.

*   **Wildcards.** A switch case containing the identifier `_` currently matches
    if the matched value is equal to the constant named `_`. With this proposal,
    it becomes a wildcard that always matches. I did not find any switch cases
    whose expression is `_`.

*   **Constant constructors.** A switch case can be a constant constructor call
    with implicit `const`, like:

    ```dart
    case SomeClass(1, 2):
    ```

    With this proposal, that is interpreted as an extractor pattern whose
    arguments are subpatterns. In cases where the matched value is also a
    constant, this will *likely* behave the same but may not. I found 8 switch
    cases of this form (0.008%).

*   **Other constant expressions.** Constant patterns allow simple literals and
    references to named constants to be used directly as patterns, which covers
    the majority of all existing switch cases. Also a constant constructor
    explicitly prefixed with `const` is a valid constant expression pattern. But
    some more complex expressions are valid constant expressions but not valid
    constant patterns. In the switch cases I analyzed, the exceptions are:

    ```
    case A + A:                                         // Infix "+".
    case A + 'b':                                       // Infix "+".
    case -ERR_LDS_ICAO_SIGNED_DATA_SIGNER_INFOS_EMPTY:  // Unary "-".
    case -sigkill:                                      // Unary "-".
    case List<RPChoice>:                                // Generic type literal.
    case 720 * 1280:                                    // Infix "*".
    case 1080 * 1920:                                   // Infix "*".
    case 1440 * 2560:                                   // Infix "*".
    case 2160 * 3840:                                   // Infix "*".
    ```

    These nine cases represent 0.009% of the cases found.

For any switch case that is broken by this proposal, you can revert back to the
original behavior by prefixing the case expression (now pattern) with `const`:

```dart
// List or map literal:
case const [a, b]:

// Const constructor call:
case const SomeClass(1, 2):

// Other constant expression:
case const A + A:
case const A + 'b':
case const -ERR_LDS_ICAO_SIGNED_DATA_SIGNER_INFOS_EMPTY:
case const -sigkill:
case const List<RPChoice>:
case const 720 * 1280:
case const 1080 * 1920:
case const 1440 * 2560:
case const 2160 * 3840:
```

We can determine syntactically whether an existing switch case's behavior will
be changed by this proposal, so this fix can be easily automated and applied
mechanically.

#### Guard clause

We also allow an optional *guard clause* to appear after a case. This enables a
switch case to evaluate an arbitrary predicate after matching. Guards are useful
because when the predicate evaluates to false, execution proceeds to the next
case instead of exiting the entire switch like it would if you nested an `if`
statement inside the switch case's body:

```dart
var pair = (1, 2);

// This prints nothing:
switch (pair) {
  case (a, b):
    if (a > b) print('First element greater');
    break;
  case (a, b):
    print('Other order');
    break;
}

// This prints "Other order":
switch (pair) {
  case (a, b) when a > b:
    print('First element greater');
    break;
  case (a, b):
    print('Other order');
    break;
}
```

#### Implicit break

A long-running annoyance with switch statements is the mandatory `break`
statements at the end of each case body. Dart does not allow fallthrough, so
these `break` statements have no real effect. They exist so that Dart code does
not *appear* to be doing fallthrough to users coming from languages like C that
do allow it. That is a high syntactic tax for limited benefit.

I inspected the 25,014 switch cases in the most recent 1,000 packages on pub
(10,599,303 LOC). 26.40% of the statements in them are `break`. 28.960% of the
cases contain only a *single* statement followed by a `break`. This means
`break` is a fairly large fraction of the statements in all switches even though
it does nothing.

Therefore, this proposal removes the requirement that each non-empty case body
definitely exit. Instead, a non-empty case body implicitly jumps to the end of
the switch after completion. From the spec, remove:

> If *s* is a non-empty block statement, let *s* instead be the last statement
> of the block statement. It is a compile-time error if *s* is not a `break`,
> `continue`, `rethrow` or `return` statement or an expression statement where
> the expression is a `throw` expression.

This is now valid code that prints "one":

```dart
switch (1) {
  case 1:
    print("one");
  case 2:
    print("two");
}
```

Empty cases continue to fallthrough to the next case as before. This prints "one
or two":

```dart
switch (1) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    print("one or two");
}
```

To have an empty case that does *not* fallthrough, use `break;` for its body as
you would today.

### Switch expression

When you want an `if` statement in an expression context, you can use a
conditional expression (`?:`). There is no expression form for multi-way
branching, so we define a new switch expression. It takes code like this:

```dart
Color shiftHue(Color color) {
  switch (color) {
    case Color.red:
      return Color.orange;
    case Color.orange:
      return Color.yellow;
    case Color.yellow:
      return Color.green;
    case Color.green:
      return Color.blue;
    case Color.blue:
      return Color.purple;
    case Color.purple:
      return Color.red;
  }
}
```

And turns it into:

```dart
Color shiftHue(Color color) {
  return switch (color) {
    case Color.red => Color.orange;
    case Color.orange => Color.yellow;
    case Color.yellow => Color.green;
    case Color.green => Color.blue;
    case Color.blue => Color.purple;
    case Color.purple => Color.red;
  };
}
```

The grammar is:

```
primary               ::= // Existing productions...
                        | switchExpression

switchExpression      ::= 'switch' '(' expression ')' '{'
                          switchExpressionCase* defaultExpressionCase? '}'
switchExpressionCase  ::= caseHead '=>' expression ';'
defaultExpressionCase ::= 'default' '=>' expression ';'
```

Slotting into `primary` means it can be used anywhere any expression can appear,
even as operands to unary and binary operators. Many of these uses are ugly, but
not any more problematic than using a collection literal in the same context
since a `switch` expression is always delimited by a `switch` and `}`.

Making it high precedence allows useful patterns like:

```dart
await switch (n) {
  case 1 => aFuture;
  case 2 => anotherFuture;
  default => otherwiseFuture;
};

var x = switch (n) {
  case 1 => obj;
  case 2 => another;
  default => otherwise;
}.someMethod();
```

Over half of the switch cases in a large corpus of packages contain either a
single return statement or an assignment followed by a break so there is some
evidence this will be useful.

#### Expression statement ambiguity

Thanks to expression statements, a switch expression could appear in the same
position as a switch statement. This isn't technically ambiguous, but requires
unbounded lookahead to tell if a switch in statement position is a statement or
expression.

```dart
main() {
  switch (some(extremely, long, expression, here)) {
    case Some(Quite(:var long, :var pattern)) => expression();
  };

  switch (some(extremely, long, expression, here)) {
    case Some(Quite(:var long, :var pattern)): statement();
  }
}
```

To avoid that, we disallow a switch expression from appearing at the beginning
of an expression statement. This is similar to existing restrictions on map
literals appearing in expression statements. In the rare case where a user
really wants one there, they can parenthesize it.

**TODO: If we change switch expressions [to use `:` instead of `=>`][2126] then
there will be an actual ambiguity. In that case, reword the above section.**

[2126]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2126

### If-case statement

Often you want to conditionally match and destructure some data, but you only
want to test a value against a single pattern. A `switch` statement works but is
verbose:

```dart
switch (json) {
  case [int x, int y]:
    return Point(x, y);
}
```

We can make simple uses like this better by extending if statements to allow
`case` followed by a pattern:

```dart
if (json case [int x, int y]) return Point(x, y);
```

It may have an else branch as well:

```dart
if (json case [int x, int y]) {
  print('Was coordinate array $x,$y');
} else {
  throw FormatException('Invalid JSON.');
}
```

We replace the existing `ifStatement` rule with:

```
ifStatement ::= 'if' '(' expression caseHead? ')' statement ('else' statement)?
```

**TODO: Allow patterns in if elements too.**

When the `condition` has no `caseHead`, it behaves as it does today. If there is
a `caseHead`, then the expression is evaluated and matched against the
subsequent pattern. If it matches, the then branch is executed with any
variables the pattern defines in scope. Otherwise, the else branch is executed
if there is one.

A guard is also allowed:

```
if (json case [int x, int y] when x == y) {
  print('Was on coordinate x-y intercept');
} else {
  throw FormatException('Invalid JSON.');
}
```

### Pattern context

Patterns appear inside a number of constructs in the language which we
categorize into three contexts:

*   **Declaration context.** The pattern in `localVariableDeclaration`,
    `forLoopParts`, or any of its subpatterns. Here, the innermost patterns are
    usually identifiers for the names of the new variables being bound.

*   **Assignment context.** The pattern in a `patternAssignment` or any of its
    subpatterns. The innermost subpatterns are again identifiers, but they refer
    to existing variables that are being assigned.

*   **Matching context.** The pattern in a `caseHead` or any of its subpatterns.
    The innermost subpatterns are often constant expressions that the value is
    compared against to see if the case matches. They may also be variable
    declarations to extract parts of the value for later processing when the
    case matches.

We refer to declaration and assignment contexts as *irrefutable contexts*.

While most patterns look and act the same regardless of where they appear in the
language, context places some restrictions on which kinds of patterns are
allowed and what their syntax is. The rules are:

*   It is a compile-time error if any of the following *refutable patterns*
    appear in an irrefutable context:

    *   Logical-or
    *   Relational
    *   Null-check
    *   Constant

    *All of these patterns are refutable and may fail to match. In a matching
    context like a switch case, if a pattern fails to match, execution skips
    over the case body to ensure that variables bound by the pattern can only
    be used when the pattern matches. Declaration and assignment contexts have
    no control flow, so they can only use patterns that will always match.*

    *Logical-or patterns are refutable because there is no point in using one
    with an irrefutable left operand. We could make null-check patterns
    irrefutable if `V` is assignable to its static type, but whenever that is
    true the pattern does nothing useful since its only behavior is a type
    test.*

    *The remaining patterns are allowed syntactically to appear in a refutable
    context. Patterns that do type tests like variables and lists produce a
    compile-time error when used in an irrefutable context if the static type of
    the matched value isn't assignable to their required type. This error is
    specified under type checking.*

*   It is a compile-time error if a variable pattern in a declaration context is
    marked `var` or `final`. *A pattern declaration statement is already
    preceded by `var` or `final`, so allowing those on the variable patterns
    inside would lead to unnecessary or confusing code like:*

    ```dart
    // Disallowed:
    var [var x] = [1];
    final [var y] = [2];
    ```

    *To declare variables in a declaration context, use a simple identifer:*

    ```dart
    // OK:
    var [x] = [1];
    final [y] = [2];
    ```

*   It is a compile-time error if a variable pattern in an assignment context is
    marked `var`, `final`, or with a type annotation. *Patterns in assignments
    can only assign to existing variables, not declare new ones.*

    ```dart
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;

    // Disallowed:
    (var a, int b) = (3, 4);

    // OK:
    (a, b) = (3, 4);
    ```

*   A simple identifier in a matching context is treated as a named constant
    pattern unless its name is `_`. *A bare identifier is ambiguous and could
    be either a named constant or a variable pattern without any `var`, `final`,
    or type annotation marker. We prefer the constant interpretation for
    backwards compatibility and to make variable declarations more explicit in
    cases. To declare variables in a matching context, use `var`, `final`, or a
    type before the name.*

    *There is no ambiguity with bare identifiers in irrefutable contexts since
    constant patterns are disallowed there.*

    ```dart
    const c = 1;
    switch (2) {
      case c: print('match $c');
      default: print('no match');
    }
    ```

    *This program prints "no match" and not "match 2".*

*   A simple identifier in a matching context named `_` is treated as a wildcard
    variable pattern. *A bare `_` is always treated as a wildcard regardless of
    context, even though other variables in matching contexts require a marker.*

    ```dart
    // OK:
    switch (triple) {
      case [_, var y, _]: print('The middle element is $y');
    }
    ```

    *You can also use `var _` or `final _` to write a wildcard in a matching
    context because it would require additional specification to explicitly
    forbid it, but doing so is discouraged.*

*In short, you can't use refutable patterns in places that don't do control
flow. Use simple identifiers (optionally with type annotations) to declare
variables in pattern declarations. Use simple identifiers to assign to variables
in pattern assignments. Use explicitly marked identifiers to declare variables
in `case` patterns. Use `_` anywhere for a wildcard.*

## Static semantics

### Type inference

Type inference in Dart allows type information in one part of the program to
flow over and fill in missing pieces in another part. Inference can flow
"upwards" from a subexpression to the surrounding expression:

```dart
[1]
```

Here, we infer `List<int>` for the type of the list literal based on type of its
element. Inference can flow "downwards" from an expression into its
subexpressions too:

```dart
<List<int>>[[]]
```

Here, the inner empty list literal `[]` gets type `List<int>` because the type
argument on the outer list literal is pushed into it.

Type information can flow through patterns in the same way. From subpatterns
upwards to the surrounding pattern:

```dart
var [int x] = ...
```

Here, we infer `List<int>` for the list pattern based on the type of the element
subpattern. Or downwards:

```dart
var <int>[x] = ...
```

Here, we infer `int` for the inner `x` subpattern based on the type of the
surrounding list pattern.

In variable declarations, type information can also flow between the variable
and its initializer. "Upwards" from initializer to variable:

```dart
var x = 1;
```

Here we infer `int` for `x` based on the initializer expression's type. That
upwards flow extends to patterns:

```dart
var [x] = <int>[1];
```

Here, we infer `List<int>` for the list pattern (and thus `int` for the `x`
subpattern) based on type of the initializer expression `<int>[1]`.

Types can also flow "downwards" from variable to initializer:

```dart
List<int> x = [];
```

Here, the empty list is instantiated as `List<int>` because the type annotation
on `x` gets pushed over to the initializer. That extends to patterns:

```dart
var <num>[x] = [1];
```

Here, we infer the list literal in the initializer to have type `List<num>` (and
not `List<int>`) based on the type of list pattern. All of this type flow can be
combined:

```dart
var (a, b, <double>[c], [int d]) = ([1], <List<int>>[[]], [2], [3]);
```

To orchestrate this, type inference on patterns proceeds in three phases:

1.  **Calculate the pattern type schema.** Start at the top of the pattern and
    recurse downwards into subpatterns using the surrounding pattern as context.
    When we reach the leaves, work back upwards filling in missing pieces where
    possible. When this completes, we have a type schema for the pattern. It's
    a type *schema* and not a *type* because there may be holes where types
    aren't known yet.

2.  **Calculate the static type of the matched value.** A pattern always occurs
    in the context of some matched value. For pattern variable declarations,
    this is the initializer. For switches and if-case statements, it's the value
    being matched.

    Using the pattern's type schema as a context type, infer missing types on
    the value expression. This is the existing type inference rules on
    expressions. It yields a complete static type for the matched value.

3.  **Calculate the static type of the pattern.** Using that value type, recurse
    through the pattern again downwards to the leaf subpatterns filling in any
    holes in the type schema. When that completes, we now have a full static
    type for the pattern and all of its subpatterns.

The full process only comes into play for pattern variable declarations and
pattern assignment. For switch cases and if-case statements, the pattern context
type schema is not used and no downwards inference is performed from the pattern
to the matched value expression.

*It would be hard to apply inference from cases in a switch to the value since
there are multiple cases and it's not clear how to unify that. Even in case-if
statements, it's not clear that downwards inference is desirable, since the
intent of the pattern is to ask a question about the matched object, and not
necessarily to try to force a certain answer.*

#### Pattern context type schema

In a non-pattern variable declaration, the variable's type annotation is used
for downwards inference of the initializer:

```dart
List<int> list = []; // Infer <int>[].
```

Patterns extend this behavior:

```dart
var (List<int> list, <num>[a]) = ([], [1]); // Infer (<int>[], <num>[]).
```

To support this, every pattern has a context type schema which is used as the
downwards inference context on the matched value expression in pattern variable
declarations and pattern assignments. This is a type *schema* because there may
be holes in the type:

```dart
var (a, int b) = ... // Schema is `(?, int)`.
```

The context type schema for a pattern `p` is:

*   **Logical-or**: The least upper bound of the context type schemas of the
    branches.

*   **Logical-and**: The greatest lower bound of the context type schemas of the
    branches.

    **TODO: Figure out if LUB and GLB are defined for type schemas.**

*   **Null-check** or **null-assert**: A context type schema `E?` where `E` is
    the context type schema of the inner pattern. *For example:*

    ```dart
    var [[int x]!] = [[]]; // Infers List<List<int>?> for the list literal.
    ```

*   **Constant**: The context type schema is the static type of the pattern's
    value.

*   **Variable**:

    1.  In an assignment context, the context type schema is the static type of
        the variable that `p` resolves to.

    1.  Else if `p` has no type annotation, the context type schema is `?`.
        *This lets us potentially infer the variable's type from the matched
        value.*

    2.  Else the context type schema is the annotated type. *When a typed
        variable pattern is used in a destructuring variable declaration, we
        do push the type over to the value for inference, as in:*

        ```dart
        var (items: List<int> x) = (items: []);
        //                                 ^- Infers List<int>.
        ```

*   **Relational** or **cast**: The context type schema is `Object?`.

*   **Parenthesized**: The context type schema of the inner subpattern.

*   **List**: A context type schema `List<E>` where:

    1.  If `p` has a type argument, then `E` is the type argument.

    2.  Else if `p` has no elements then `E` is `Object?`. *If the pattern
        doesn't destructure anything, it matches any list, so it is permissive
        with the context type.*

    3.  Else `E` is the greatest lower bound of the type schemas of all element
        subpatterns. *We use the greatest lower bound to ensure that the outer
        collection type has a precise enough type to ensure that any typed field
        subpatterns do not need to downcast:*

        ```dart
        var [int a, num b] = [1, 2];
        ```

        *Here, the GLB of `int` and `num` is `int`, which ensures that neither
        `int a` nor `num b` need to downcast their respective fields.*

*   **Map**: A type schema `Map<K, V>` where:

    1.  If `p` has type arguments then `K`, and `V` are those type arguments.

    2.  Else if `p` has no entries, then `K` and `V` are `Object?`. *If the
        pattern doesn't destructure anything, it matches any map, so it is
        permissive with the context type.*

    3.  Else `K` is the least upper bound of the types of all key expressions
        and `V` is the greatest lower bound of the context type schemas of all
        value subpatterns.

*   **Record**: A record type schema with positional and named fields
    corresponding to the type schemas of the corresponding field subpatterns.

*   **Extractor**: The type the extractor name resolves to. *This lets inference
    fill in type arguments in the value based on the extractor's type arguments,
    as in:*

    ```dart
    var Foo<num>() = Foo();
    //                  ^-- Infer Foo<num>.
    ```

#### Type checking and pattern required type

Once the value a pattern is matched against has a static type (which means
downwards inference on it using the pattern's context type schema is complete),
we can type check the pattern.

Also variable, list, map, record, and extractor patterns only match a value of a
certain *required type*. These patterns are prohibited in an irrefutable context
if the matched value isn't assignable to that type. We define the required type
for those patterns here. Some examples and the corresponding required types:

```dart
var <int>[a, b] = <num>[1, 2];  // List<int> (and compile error).
var [a, b] = <num>[1, 2];       // List<num>, a is num, b is num.
var [int a, b] = <num>[1, 2];   // List<num>.
```

To type check a pattern `p` being matched against a value of type `M`:

*   **Logical-or** and **logical-and**: Type check each branch using `M` as the
    matched value type.

*   **Relational**:

    1.  Let `C` be the static type of the right operand constant expression.

    2.  If the operator is a comparison (`<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`), then it is a
        compile-time error if:

        *   `M` does not define that operator,
        *   `C` is not assignable to the operator's parameter type,
        *   or if the operator's return type is not assignable to `bool`.

    3.  Else the operator is `==` or `!=`. It is a compile-time error if `C?` is
        not assignable to `M`'s `==` method parameter type. *The language
        screens out `null` before calling the underlying `==` method, which is
        why `C?` is the allowed type. Since Object declares `==` to accept
        `Object` on the right, this compile-time error can only happen if a
        user-defined class has an override of `==` with a `covariant`
        parameter.*

*   **Cast**:

    1.  Resolve the type name to a type `X`. It is a compile-time error if
        the name does not refer to a type.

    2.  Type-check the subpattern using `X` as the matched value type.

*   **Null-check** or **null-assert**:

    1.  Let `N` be [**NonNull**][nonnull](`M`).

    2.  Type-check the subpattern using `N` as the matched value type.

    [nonnull]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/2.12/nnbd/feature-specification.md#null-promotion

*   **Constant**: Type check the pattern's value in context type `M`. *The
    context type comes into play for things like type arguments and
    int-to-double:*

    ```dart
    double d = 1.0;
    switch (d) {
      case 1: ...
    }
    ```

    *Here, the `1` constant pattern in the case is inferred in a context type of
    `double` to be `1.0` and so does match.*

*   **Variable**:

    1.  In an assignment context, the required type of `p` is the (unpromoted)
        static type of the variable that `p` resolves to.

    2.  Else if the variable has a type annotation, the required type of `p` is
        that type, as is the static type of the variable introduced by `p`.

    3.  Else the required type of `p` is `M`, as is the static type of the
        variable introduced by `p`. *This means that an untyped variable pattern
        can have its type indirectly inferred from the type of a superpattern:*

        ```dart
        var <(num, Object)>[(a, b)] = [(1, true)]; // a is num, b is Object.
        ```

        *The pattern's context type schema is `List<(num, Object>)`. Downwards
        inference uses that to infer `List<(num, Object>)` for the initializer.
        That inferred type is then destructured and used to infer `num` for `a`
        and `Object` for `b`.*

*   **Parenthesized**: Type-check the inner subpattern using `M` as the matched
    value type.

*   **List**:

    1.  Calculate the value's element type `E`:

        1.  If `M` implements `List<T>` for some `T` then `E` is `T`.

        2.  Else if `M` is `dynamic` then `E` is `dynamic`.

        3.  Else `E` is `Object?`.

    2.  Type-check each element subpattern using `E` as the matched value type.
        *Note that we calculate a single element type and use it for all
        subpatterns. In:*

        ```dart
        var [a, b] = [1, 2.3];
        ```

        *both `a` and `b` use `num` as their matched value type.*

    3.  The required type of `p` is `List<S>` where:

        1.  If `p` has a type argument, `S` is that type. *If the list pattern
            has an explicit type argument, that wins.*

        2.  Else `S` is `E`. *Otherwise, infer the type from the matched value.*

*   **Map**:

    1.  Calculate the value's entry key type `K` and value type `V`:

        1.  If `M` implements `Map<K, V>` for some `K` and `V` then use those.

        2.  Else if `M` is `dynamic` then `K` and `V` are `dynamic`.

        3.  Else `K` and `V` are `Object?`.

    2.  Type-check each value subpattern using `V` as the matched value type.
        *Like lists, we calculate a single value type and use it for all value
        subpatterns:*

        ```dart
        var {1: a, 2: b} = {1: "str", 2: bool};
        ```

        *Here, both `a` and `b` use `Object` as the matched value type.*

    3.  The required type of `p` is `Map<L, W>` where:

        1.  If `p` has type arguments, `L` and `W` are those type arguments.
            *If the map pattern is explicitly typed, that wins.*

        2.  Else `L` is `K` and `W` is `V`.

*   **Record**:

    1.  Type-check each of `f`'s positional field subpatterns using the
        corresponding positional field type on `M` as the matched value type or
        `Object?` if `M` is not a record type with the corresponding field. *The
        field subpattern will only be matched at runtime if the value does turn
        out to be a record with the right shape where the field is present, so
        it's safe to just assume the field exists when type checking here.*

    2.  Type check each of `f`'s named field subpatterns using the type of the
        corresponding named field on `M` as the matched value type or `Object?`
        if `M` is not a record type with the corresponding field.

    3.  The required type of `p` is a record type with the same shape as `p` and
        `Object?` for all fields. *If the matched value's type is `dynamic` or
        some record supertype like `Object`, then the record pattern should
        match any record with the right shape and then delegate to its field
        subpatterns to ensure that the fields match.*

*   **Extractor**:

    1.  Resolve the extractor name to a type `X`. It is a compile-time error if
        the name does not refer to a type. Apply downwards inference from `M`
        to infer type arguments for `X` if needed.

    1.  Type-check each of `f`'s field subpatterns using the type of the getter
        on `X` with the same name as the field as the matched value type. It is
        a compile-time error if `X` does not have a getter whose name matches
        the subpattern's field name.

    2.  The required type of `p` is `X`.

It is a compile-time error if:

*   The type of an expression in a guard clause is not assignable to `bool`.

*   `p` is in an irrefutable context, it has a required type `T`, and `M` is not
    assignable to `T`. *Destructuring and variable patterns can only be used in
    declarations and assignments if we can statically tell that the
    destructuring and variable binding won't fail to match (though it might
    throw a runtime exception from implicit downcasts from `dynamic`).*

### Pattern uses

It is a compile-time error if the expression in a guard clause in a switch case
or if-case statement is not assignable to `bool`.

The static type of a switch expression is the least upper bound of the static
types of all of the case expressions.

### Variables and scope

Patterns often exist to introduce new variable bindings. A "wildcard" identifier
named `_` in a variable pattern never introduces a binding.
The variables a patterns binds depend on what kind of pattern it is:

*   **Logical-or**: Does not introduce variables but may contain subpatterns
    that do. It is a compile-time error if the two subpatterns do not introduce
    the same variables with the same names and types.

    **TODO: "Same name" is underspecified and also probably
    [too conservative][2473].**

*   **Logical-and**, **cast**, **null-check**, **null-assert**,
    **parenthesized**, **list**, **map**, **record**, or **extractor**: These do
    not introduce variables themselves but may contain subpatterns that do.

*   **Relational** or **constant**: These do not introduce any variables.

*   **Variable**: When not in an assignment context, introduces a variable whose
    name is the pattern's identifier. In a declaration context, the variable is
    final if the surrounding `patternDeclaration` has a `final` modifier. In a
    matching context, the variable is final if the variable pattern is marked
    `final` and is not otherwise.

[2473]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2473

The scope where a pattern's variables are declared and available for use depends
on the construct that contains the pattern:

*   **Local pattern variable declaration**: The rest of the block following
    the declaration.
*   **For loop pattern variable declaration**: The body of the loop and the
    condition and increment clauses in a C-style for loop.
*   **Switch statement case**: The guard clause and the statements of the
    subsequent non-empty case body.
*   **Switch expression case**: The guard clause and the case expression.
*   **If-case statement**: The guard clause and then statement.

Multiple switch case patterns may share the same variable scope if their case
bodies are empty:

```dart
switch (obj) {
  case [int a, int b]:
  case {"a": int a, "b": int b}:
    print(a + b); // OK.

  case [int a]:
  case (String a): // Error.
    break;
}
```

This would normally be a name collision, but we make an exception to allow this.
However, it is a compile-time error if all switch case patterns that share a
body do not all define the exact same variables with the exact same types.

*Aside from this special case, note that since all variables declared by a
pattern and its subpatterns go into the same scope, it is an error if two
subpatterns declare a variable with the same name, unless the name is `_`.*

### Type promotion

**TODO: Specify how pattern matching may show that existing variables have some
type.**

### Exhaustiveness and reachability

A switch is *exhaustive* if all possible values of the matched value's type will
definitely match at least one case, or there is a default case. Dart currently
shows a warning if a switch statement on an enum type does not have cases for
all enum values (or a default). This is helpful for code maintainance: when you
add a new value to an enum type, the language shows you every switch statement
that may need a new case to handle it.

This checking is even more important with this proposal. Exhaustiveness checking
is a key part of maintaining code written in an algebraic datatype style. It's
the functional equivalent of the error reported when a concrete class fails to
implement an abstract method.

Exhaustiveness checking over arbitrarily deeply nested record and extractor
patterns can be complex, so the proposal for that is in a [separate
document][exhaustiveness].

## Runtime semantics

### Execution

Most of the runtime behavior is defined in the "matching" section below, but
the constructs where patterns appear have their own (hopefully obvious)
behavior.

#### Pattern variable declaration

1.  Evaluate the initializer expression producing a value `v`.

2.  Match `v` against the declaration's pattern.

#### Pattern assignment

1.  Evaluate the right-hand side expression to a value `v`.

2.  Match `v` against the pattern on the left. When matching a variable pattern
    against a value `o`, record that `o` will be the new value for the
    corresponding variable, but do not store the variable.

3.  Once all destructuring and matching is done, store all of the assigned
    variables with their corresponding values.

*In other words, it's as if every variable pattern in an assignment expression
is a new variable declaration with a hidden name. Then after the assignment
expression and matching completes, those temporary variables are all written to
the corresponding real variables. We defer the storage until matching has
completed so that users never see a partial assignment if matching happens to
fail in some way.*

#### Switch statement

1.  Evaluate the switch value producing `v`.

2.  For each case:

    1.  Match the case's pattern against `v`. If the match fails then continue
        to the next case (or default clause or exit the switch if there are no
        other cases).

    2.  If there is a guard clause, evaluate it. If it does not evaluate to a
        Boolean, throw a runtime error. *This can happen if the guard
        expression's type is `dynamic`.* If it evaluates to `false`, continue to
        the next case (or default or exit).

    3.  Execute the nearest non-empty case body at or following this case.
        *You're allowed to have multiple empty cases where all preceding
        ones share the same body with the last case.*

    4.  Exit the switch statement. *An explicit `break` is no longer
        required.*

3.  If no case pattern matched and there is a default clause, execute the
    statements after it.

4.  If no case matches and there is no default clause, throw a runtime
    error. *This can only occur when `null` or a legacy typed value flows
    into this switch statement from another library that hasn't migrated to
    [null safety][]. In fully migrated programs, exhaustiveness checking is
    sound and it isn't possible to reach this runtime error.*

[null safety]: https://dart.dev/null-safety

#### Switch expression

1.  Evaluate the switch value producing `v`.

2.  For each case:

    1.  Match the case's pattern against `v`. If the match fails then continue
        to the next case (or default clause if there are no other cases).

    2.  If there is a guard clause, evaluate it. If it does not evaluate to a
        Boolean, throw a runtime error. If it evaluates to `false`, continue to
        the next case (or default clause).

    3.  Evaluate the expression after the case and yield that as the result of
        the entire switch expression.

3.  If no case pattern matched and there is a default clause, execute the
    expression after it and yield that as the result of the entire switch
    expression.

4.  If no case matches and there is no default clause, throw a runtime error.
    *This can only occur when `null` or a legacy typed value flows into this
    switch expression from another library that hasn't migrated to [null
    safety][]. In fully migrated programs, exhaustiveness checking is sound and
    it isn't possible to reach this runtime error.*

#### Pattern-for statement

A statement of the form:

```dart
for (<patternDeclaration>; <condition>; <increment>) <statement>
```

Is executed similar to a traditional for loop except that multiple variables may
be declared by the pattern instead of just one. As with a normal for loop, those
variables are freshly bound to new values at each iteration so that if a
function closes over a variable, it captures the value at the current iteration
and is not affected by later iteration.

The increment clause is evaluated in a scope where all variables declared in the
pattern are freshly bound to new variables holding the current iteration's
values. If the increment clause assigns to any of the variables declared by the
pattern, those become the values bound to those variables in the next iteration.
For example:

```dart
var fns = <Function()>[];
for (var (a, b) = (0, 1); a <= 13; (a, b) = (b, a + b)) {
  fns.add(() {
    print(a);
  });
}

for (var fn in fns) {
  fn();
}
```

This prints `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`.

#### Pattern-for-in statement

A statement of the form:

```dart
for (<keyword> <pattern> in <expression>) <statement>
```

Where `<keyword>` is `var` or `final` is treated like so:

1.  Let `I` be the type of `<expression>`.

2.  Calculate the element type of `I`:

    1.  If `I` implements `Iterable<T>` for some `T` then `E` is `T`.

    2.  Else if `I` is `dynamic` then `E` is `dynamic`.

    3.  Else it is a compile-time error.

3.  Type check `<pattern>` with matched value type `E`.

4.  If there are no compile-time errors, then execution proceeds as the
    following code, where `id1` and `id2` are fresh identifiers:

    ```
    var id1 = <expression>;
    var id2 = id1.iterator;
    while (id2.moveNext()) {
      <keyword> <pattern> = id2.current;
      { <statement> }
    }
    ```

#### If-case statement

1.  Evaluate the `expression` producing `v`.

2.  Match the `pattern` in the `caseHead` against `v`.

3.  If the match succeeds:

    1.  If there is a guard clause:

        1.  Evaluate it. If it does not evaluate to a Boolean, throw a runtime
            error. *This can happen if the guard expression's type is
            `dynamic`.*

        1.  If the guard evaluates to `true`, execute the then `statement`.

        2.  Else, execute the else `statement` if there is one.

    2.  Else there is no guard clause. Execute the then `statement`.

4.  Else the match failed. Execute the else `statement` if there is one.

### Matching (refuting and destructuring)

At runtime, a pattern is matched against a value. This determines whether or not
the match *fails* and the pattern *refutes* the value. If the match succeeds,
the pattern may also *destructure* data from the object or *bind* variables.

Refutable patterns usually occur in a context where match refutation causes
execution to skip over the body of code where any variables bound by the pattern
are in scope. If a pattern match failure occurs in irrefutable context, a
runtime error is thrown. *This can happen when matching against a value of type
`dynamic`, or when a list pattern in a variable declaration is matched against a
list of a different length.*

To match a pattern `p` against a value `v`:

*   **Logical-or**:

    1.  Match the left subpattern against `v`. If it matches, the logical-or
        match succeeds.

    2.  Otherwise, match the right subpattern against `v` and succeed if it
        matches.

*   **Logical-and**:

    1.  Match the left subpattern against `v`. If the match fails, the
        logical-and match fails.

    2.  Otherwise, match the right subpattern against `v` and succeed if it
        matches.

*   **Relational**:

    1.  Evaluate the right-hand constant expression to `c`.

    2.  A `== c` pattern matches if `v == c` evaluates to true. *This takes into
        account the built-in semantics that `null` is only equal to `null`.*

    3.  A `!= c` pattern matches if `v == e` evaluates to false. *This takes
        into account the built-in semantics that `null` is not equal to anything
        but `null`.*

    4.  For any other operator, the pattern matches if calling the operator
        method of the same name on the matched value, with `c` as the argument
        returns true.

*   **Cast**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the cast type of `p` then
        throw a runtime error. *Note that we throw even if this appears in a
        matching context. The intent of this pattern is to assert that a value
        *must* have some type.*

    2.  Otherwise, match the inner pattern against `v`.

*   **Null-check**:

    1.  If `v` is null then the match fails.

    2.  Otherwise, match the inner pattern against `v`.

*   **Null-assert**:

    1.  If `v` is null then throw a runtime error. *Note that we throw even if
        this appears in a matching context. The intent of this pattern is to
        assert that a value *must* not be null.*

    2.  Otherwise, match the inner pattern against `v`.

*   **Constant**:

    1.  Evaluate the pattern's value to `c`.

    2.  The pattern matches if `c == v` evaluates to `true`. *This is opposite
        the operand order that relational patterns use. This is deliberate to
        preserve compatibility with existing switch cases and continue to enable
        compilers to determine exactly which concrete `==` method is called in a
        constant pattern for optimization purposes.*

*   **Variable**:

    1.  Let `T` be the static type of the variable `p` declares or assigns to.

    2.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of `T` then the match fails.

    3.  Otherwise, store `v` in `p`'s variable and the match succeeds.

*   **Parenthesized**: Match the subpattern against `v` and succeed if it
    matches.

*   **List**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails. *The list pattern's type will be `List<T>` for
        some `T` determined either by the pattern's explicit type argument or
        inferred from the matched value type.*

    2.  If the length of the list determined by calling `length` is not equal to
        the number of subpatterns, then the match fails. *This match failure
        becomes a runtime exception if the list pattern is in a variable
        declaration.*

    3.  Otherwise, for each element subpattern, in source order:

        1.  Extract the element value `e` by calling `[]` on `v` with an
            appropriate integer index.

        2.  Match `e` against the element subpattern.

    4.  The match succeeds if all subpatterns match.

*   **Map**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails. *The map pattern's type will be `Map<K, V>` for
        some `K` and `V` determined either by the pattern's explicit type
        arguments or inferred from the matched value type.*

    2.  If the length of the map determined by calling `length` is not equal to
        the number of subpatterns, then the match fails. *This match failure
        becomes a runtime exception if the map pattern is in a variable
        declaration.*

    3.  Otherwise, for each entry in `p`:

        1.  Evaluate the key `expression` to `k` and call `containsKey()` on the
            value. If this returns `false`, the map does not match.

        2.  Otherwise, evaluate `v[k]` and match the resulting value against
            this entry's value subpattern. If it does not match, the map does
            not match.

    4.  The match succeeds if all entry subpatterns match.

    *Note that, unlike with lists, a matched map may have additional entries
    that are not checked by the pattern.*

*   **Record**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a record type with the same type as
        the static type of `p`, then the match fails.

    2.  For each field `f` in `p`, in source order:

        1.  Access the corresponding field in record `v` as `r`.

        2.  Match the subpattern of `f` against `r`. If the match fails, the
            record match fails.

    3.  The match succeeds if all field subpatterns match.

*   **Extractor**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails.

    3.  Otherwise, for each field `f` in `p`:

        1.  Call the getter with the same name as `f` on `v` to a result `r`.

        2.  Match the subpattern of `f` against `r`. If the match fails, the
            extractor match fails.

    3.  The match succeeds if all field subpatterns match.

**TODO: Update to specify that the result of operations can be cached across
cases. See: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2107**

## Severability

This proposal, along with the records and exhaustiveness documents it depends
on, is a lot of new language work. There is new syntax to parse, new type
checking and inference features (including quite complex exhaustiveness
checking), a new kind of object that needs a runtime representation and runtime
type, and new imperative behavior.

It might be too much to fit into a single Dart release. However, it isn't
necessary to ship every corner of these proposals all at once. If needed for
scheduling reasons, we could stage it across several releases.

Here is one way it could be broken down into separate pieces:

*   **Records and destructuring.** Record expressions and record types are one
    of the most-desired aspects of this proposal. Currently, there is no
    expression syntax for accessing positional fields from a record. That means
    we need destructuring. So, at a minimum:

    *   Record expressions and types
    *   Pattern variable declarations
    *   Record patterns
    *   Variable patterns

    This would not include any refutable patterns, so doesn't need the changes
    to allow patterns in switches.

*   **Collection destructuring.** A minor extension of the above is to also
    allow destructuring the other built-in aggregate types:

    *   List patterns
    *   Map patterns

*   **Extractors.** I don't want patterns to feel like we're duct taping a
    functional feature onto an object-oriented language. To integrate it more
    gracefully means destructuring user-defined types too, so adding:

    *   Extractor patterns

*   **Refutable patterns.** The next big step is patterns that don't just
    destructure but *match*. The bare minimum refutable patterns and features
    are:

    *   Patterns in switch statement cases
    *   Switch case guards
    *   Exhaustiveness checking
    *   Constant patterns
    *   Relational patterns (at least `==`)

    The only critical relational pattern is `==` because once we allow patterns
    in switch cases, we lose the ability to have a bare identifier constant in
    a switch case.

*   **Type testing patterns.** The other type-based patterns aren't critical but
    do make patterns more convenient and useful:

    *   Null-check patterns
    *   Null-assert patterns
    *   Cast patterns

*   **Control flow.** Switch statements are heavyweight. If we want to make
    refutable patterns more useful, we eventually want:

    *   Switch expressions
    *   Pattern-if statements

*   **Logical patterns.** If we're going to add `==` patterns, we may as well
    support other Boolean infix operators. And if we're going to support the
    comparison operators, then `&` is useful for numeric ranges. It's weird to
    have `&` without `|` so we may as well do that too (and it's useful for
    switch expressions). Once we have infix patterns precedence comes into play,
    so we need parentheses to control it:

    *   Relational patterns (other than `==`)
    *   Logical-or patterns
    *   Logical-and patterns
    *   Parenthesized patterns

## Changelog

### 2.5

-   Move back to a syntax where variable declarations are explicit in cases but
    not in pattern declarations (but otherwise keep the unified grammar). Allow
    simple identifier constant patterns in cases.

-   Allow cast patterns to take a subpattern instead of just a variable name.

-   Only allow pattern assignments to assign to locals.

-   Don't allow unary patterns to nest.

-   Merge literal and constant patterns into a single kind of pattern and
    extend them to allow const constructor calls and `const` followed by a
    primary expression.

-   Replace pattern-if with if-case statements. Allow guard clauses.

-   Use the pattern context type schema for assignments but not if-case.

-   Disallow `nullCheckPattern` in `outerPattern`. Now that if-case no longer
    uses `outerPattern`, there's no point in allowing it.

### 2.4

-   Add destructuring assignment (#2438).

-   Specify the context type for empty list and map patterns (#2441).

-   Define a grammar rule for the outermost patterns in a declaration (#2446).

-   Rename "grouping" patterns to "parenthesized" patterns (#2447).

-   Specify behavior of patterns in for loops (#2448).

-   Make logical-or and null-check patterns always refutable.

### 2.3

-   Specify that switches throw a runtime error if values from legacy libraries
    flow in and break exhaustiveness checking (#2123).

-   Allow empty list, map, and record patterns (#2441).

-   Clarify ambiguity between grouping and record patterns.

### 2.2

-   Make map patterns check length like list patterns do (#2415).

-   Clarify that variables in cases are not final (#2416).

### 2.1

Minor tweaks:

-   Define the static type of switch expressions (#2380).

-   Clarify semantics of runtime type tests (#2385).

-   Allow relational operators whose return type is `dynamic`.

### 2.0

Major redesign of the syntax and minor redesign of the semantics.

-   Unify binder and matcher patterns into a single grammar. Refutable patterns
    are still prohibited outside of contexts where failure can be handled using
    control flow, but the grammar is unified and more patterns can be used in
    the other context. For example, null-assert patterns can be used in switch
    cases.

-   Always treat simple identifiers as variables in patterns, even in switch
    cases.

-   Change the `if (expr case pattern)` syntax to `if (var pattern = expr)`.

-   Change the guard syntax to `when expr`.

-   Record patterns match only record objects. Extractor patterns (which can
    now be used in variable declarations) are the only way to call getters on
    abitrary objects.

-   New patterns for relational operators, `|`, `&`, and `(...)`. Set up a
    precedence hierarchy for patterns.

-   Get rid of explicit wildcard patterns since they're redundant with untyped
    variable patterns named `_`.

-   Don't allow extractor patterns to match enum values. (It doesn't seem that
    well motivated and could be added later if useful.)

-   Remove support for `late` pattern variable declarations, patterns in
    top-level variables, and patterns in fields. The semantics get pretty weird
    and it's not clear that they're worth it.

-   Change the static typing rules significantly in a number of ways.

-   Remove type patterns. They aren't fully baked, are pretty complex, and don't
    seem critical right now. We can always add them as a later extension.

### 1.8

-   Remove declaration matcher from the proposal. It's only a syntactic sugar
    convenience and seems to cause enough confusion that it's not clear if it
    carries its weight. Removing it simplifies the feature some and we can
    always add it in a future version.

-   Remove the `Destructure_n_` interface. Positional record fields can only be
    used to destructure positional fields from actual record objects. (We may
    extend this later.)

-   Revise and clarify how types work in record and extractor patterns.

### 1.7

-   Fix object destructuring examples and clarify that extract matchers support
    the named field destructuring shorthand too ([#2193][]).

[#2193]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2193

### 1.6

-   Change syntax of if-case statement ([#2181][]).

[#2181]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2181

### 1.5

-   Introduce and clarify type inference.

-   The context type schema for a variable matcher is always `Object?`, since
    it's intent is to *match* a type and *cause* the expression to have some
    type.

### 1.4

-   Link to [exhaustiveness][] proposal.

### 1.3

-   Avoid unbounded lookahead with switch expression in an expression statement
    ([#2138][]).

-   Re-introduce rule that `_` is non-binding in all patterns, not just
    wildcards.

[#2138]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2138

### 1.2

-   Add a shorthand for destructuring a named record field to a variable with
    the same name.

-   Add if-case statement.

-   Allow extractor patterns to match enum values.

-   Add null-assert binder `!` and null-check `?` matcher patterns.

### 1.1

-   Copy editing and clean up.

-   Add `nullLiteral` to literal patterns.

-   Add wildcard binder patterns. Remove exception that variable patterns named
    `_` don't bind.

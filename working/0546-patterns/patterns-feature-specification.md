In particular, this proposal covers several coding styles and idioms users
would like to express:

### Multiple returns

Functions take not a single parameter but an entire parameter *list* because
you often want to pass multiple values in. Parameter lists give you a flexible,
ad hoc way of aggregating multiple values going into a function, but there is
no equally easy way to aggregate multiple values coming *out*. You're left with
having to create a class, which is verbose and couples any users of the API to
that specific class declaration. Or you pack the values into a List or Map and
end up losing type safety.

Records are sort of like "first class argument lists" and give you a natural
way to return multiple values:

```dart
(double, double) geoCode(String city) {
  var lat = // Calculate...
  var long = // Calculate...

  return (lat, long); // Wrap in record and return.
}
```

### Destructuring

Once you have a few values lumped into a record, you need a way to get them
back out. Record patterns in variable declarations let you *destructure* a
record value by accessing fields and binding the resulting values to new
variables:

```dart
var (lat, long) = geoCode('Aarhus');
print('Location lat:$lat, long:$long');
```

List and map patterns let you likewise destructure those respective collection
types (or any other class that implements `List` or `Map`):

```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var [a, b, c] = list;
print(a + b + c); // 6.

var map = {'first': 1, 'second': 2};
var {'first': a, 'second': b} = map;
print(a + b); // 3.
```

You can also destructure and assign to existing variables:

```dart
var (a, b) = ('left', right');
(b, a) = (a, b); // Swap!
print('$a $b'); // Prints "right left".
```

### Algebraic datatypes

You often have a family of related types and an operation that needs specific
behavior for each type. In an object-oriented language, the natural way to model
that is by implementing each operation as an instance method on its respective
type:

```dart
abstract class Shape {
  double calculateArea();
}

class Square implements Shape {
  final double length;
  Square(this.length);

  double calculateArea() => length * length;
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  final double radius;
  Circle(this.radius);

  double calculateArea() => math.pi * radius * radius;
}
```

Here, the `calculateArea()` operation is supported by all shapes by implementing
the method in each class. This works well for operations that feel closely tied
to the class, but it splits the behavior for the entire operation across many
classes and requires you to be able to add new instance methods to those
classes.

Some behavior is more naturally modeled with the operations for all types kept
together in a single function. Today, you can accomplish that using manual type
tests:

```dart
double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
  if (shape is Square) {
    return shape.length + shape.length;
  } else if (shape is Circle) {
    return math.pi * shape.radius * shape.radius;
  } else {
    throw ArgumentError("Unexpected shape.");
  }
}
```

This works, but is verbose and cumbersome. Functional languages like SML
naturally group operations together like this and use pattern matching over
algebraic datatypes to write these functions. Class hierarchies can already
essentially model an algebraic datatype. This proposal provides the pattern
matching constructs to make working with that style enjoyable:

```dart
double calculateArea(Shape shape) =>
  switch (shape) {
    case Square(length: l) => l * l;
    case Circle(radius: r) => math.pi * r * r;
  };
```

As you can see, it also adds an expression form for `switch`.

## Patterns

The core of this proposal is a new category of language construct called a
*pattern*. "Expression" and "statement" are both syntactic categories in the
grammar. Patterns form a third category. Like expressions and statements,
patterns are often composed of other subpatterns.

The basic ideas with patterns are:

*   Some can be tested against a value to determine if the pattern *matches* the
    value. If not, the pattern *refutes* the value. Other patterns, called
    *irrefutable* always match.

*   Some patterns, when they match, *destructure* the matched value by pulling
    data out of it. For example, a list pattern extracts elements from the list.
    A record pattern destructures fields from the record.

*   Variable patterns bind new variables to values that have been matched or
    destructured. The variables are in scope in a region of code that is only
    reachable when the pattern has matched.

This gives you a compact, composable notation that lets you determine if an
object has the form you expect, extract data from it, and then execute code only
when all of that is true.

Before introducing each pattern in detail, here is a summary with some examples:

| Kind | Examples |
| ---- |-------- |
| [Logical-or][logicalOrPattern] | `subpattern1 \| subpattern2` |
| [Logical-and][logicalAndPattern] | `subpattern1 & subpattern2` |
| [Relational][relationalPattern] | `== expression`<br>`< expression` |
| [Null-check][nullCheckPattern] | `subpattern?` |
| [Null-assert][nullAssertPattern] | `subpattern!` |
| [Literal][literalPattern] | `123`, `null`, `'string'` |
| [Constant][constantPattern] | `math.pi`, `SomeClass.constant` |
| [Variable][variablePattern] | `foo`, `String str`, `_`, `int _` |
| [Cast][castPattern] | `foo as String` |
| [Parenthesized][parenthesizedPattern] | `(subpattern)` |
| [List][listPattern] | `[subpattern1, subpattern2]` |
| [Map][mapPattern] | `{"key": subpattern1, someConst: subpattern2}` |
| [Record][recordPattern] | `(subpattern1, subpattern2)`<br>`(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)` |
| [Extractor][extractorPattern] | `SomeClass(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)` |

[logicalOrPattern]: #logical-or-pattern
[logicalAndPattern]: #logical-and-pattern
[relationalPattern]: #relational-pattern
[nullCheckPattern]: #null-check-pattern
[nullAssertPattern]: #null-assert-pattern
[literalPattern]: #literal-pattern
[constantPattern]: #constant-pattern
[variablePattern]: #variable-pattern
[castPattern]: #cast-pattern
[parenthesizedPattern]: #parenthesized-pattern
[listPattern]: #list-pattern
[mapPattern]: #map-pattern
[recordPattern]: #record-pattern
[extractorPattern]: #extractor-pattern

Here is the overall grammar for the different kinds of patterns:

```
pattern               ::= logicalOrPattern
patterns              ::= pattern ( ',' pattern )* ','?

logicalOrPattern      ::= logicalAndPattern ( '|' logicalOrPattern )?
logicalAndPattern     ::= relationalPattern ( '&' logicalAndPattern )?
relationalPattern     ::= ( equalityOperator | relationalOperator) relationalExpression
                        | unaryPattern

unaryPattern          ::= nullCheckPattern
                        | nullAssertPattern
                        | primaryPattern

primaryPattern        ::= literalPattern
                        | constantPattern
                        | variablePattern
                        | castPattern
                        | parenthesizedPattern
                        | listPattern
                        | mapPattern
                        | recordPattern
                        | extractorPattern
```

As you can see, logical-or patterns (`|`) have the lowest precedence, then
logical-and patterns (`&`), then the postfix unary null-check (`?`) and
null-assert (`!`) patterns, followed by the remaining highest precedence primary
patterns.

The individual patterns are:

### Logical-or pattern

```
logicalOrPattern ::= logicalAndPattern ( '|' logicalOrPattern )?
```

A pair of patterns separated by `|` matches if either of the branches match.
This can be used in a switch expression or statement to have multiple cases
share a body:

```dart
var isPrimary = switch (color) {
  case Color.red | Color.yellow | Color.blue => true;
  default => false;
};
```

Even in switch statements, which allow multiple empty cases to share a single
body, a logical-or pattern can be useful when you want multiple patterns to
share a guard:

```dart
switch (shape) {
  case Square(size) | Circle(size) when size > 0:
    print('Non-empty symmetric shape');
  case Square() | Circle():
    print('Empty symmetric shape');
  default:
    print('Asymmetric shape');
}
```

A logical-or pattern does not have to appear at the top level of a pattern. It
can be nested inside a destructuring pattern:

```dart
// Matches a two-element list whose first element is 'a' or an int:
if (var ['a' | int _, c] = list) ...
```

A logical-or pattern may match even if one of its branches does not. That means
that any variables in the non-matching branch would not be initialized. To avoid
problems stemming from that, the following restrictions apply:

*   It is a compile-time error if one branch contains a variable pattern whose
    name or type does not exactly match a corresponding variable pattern in the
    other branch. These variable patterns can appear as subpatterns anywhere in
    each branch, but in total both branches must contain the same variables with
    the same types. This way, variables used inside the body covered by the
    pattern will always be initialized to a known type.

*   If the left branch matches, the right branch is not evaluated. This
    determines *which* value the variable gets if both branches would have
    matched. In that case, it will always be the value from the left branch.

### Logical-and pattern

```
logicalAndPattern ::= relationalPattern ( '&' logicalAndPattern )?
```

A pair of patterns separated by `&` matches only if *both* subpatterns match.
Unlike logical-or patterns, the variables defined in each branch must *not*
overlap, since the logical-and pattern only matches if both branches do and
the variables in both branches will be bound.

If the left branch does not match, the right branch is not evaluated. *This only
matters because patterns may invoke user-defined methods with visible side
effects.*

### Relational pattern

```
relationalPattern ::= ( equalityOperator | relationalOperator) relationalExpression
```

A relational pattern lets you compare the matched value to a given constant
using any of the equality or relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`,
and `>=`. The pattern matches when calling the appropriate operator on the
matched value with the constant as an argument returns `true`. It is a
compile-time error if `relationalExpression` is not a valid constant expression.

The `==` operator is sometimes useful for matching named constants when the
constant doesn't have a qualified name:

```dart
void test(int value) {
  const magic = 123;
  switch (value) {
    case == magic: print('Got the magic number');
    default: print('Not the magic number');
  }
}
```

The comparison operators are useful for matching on numeric ranges, especially
when combined with `&`:

```dart
String asciiCharType(int char) {
  const space = 32;
  const zero = 48;
  const nine = 57;

  return switch (char) {
    case < space => 'control';
    case == space => 'space';
    case > space & < zero => 'punctuation';
    case >= zero & <= nine => 'digit';
    // Etc...
  }
}
```

### Null-check pattern

```
nullCheckPattern ::= unaryPattern '?'
```

A null-check pattern matches if the value is not null, and then matches the
inner pattern against that same value. Because of how type inference flows
through patterns, this also provides a terse way to bind a variable whose type
is the non-nullable base type of the nullable value being matched:

```dart
String? maybeString = ...
if (var s? = maybeString) {
  // s has type non-nullable String here.
}
```

Using `?` to match a value that is *not* null seems counterintuitive. In truth,
I have not found an ideal syntax for this. The way I think about `?` is that it
describes the test it performs. Where a list pattern tests whether the value is
a list, a `?` tests whether the value is null. However, unlike other patterns,
it matches when the value is *not* null, because matching on null isn't
useful&mdash;you could always just use a `null` literal pattern for that.

Swift [uses the same syntax for a similar feature][swift null check].

[swift null check]: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#ID520

**TODO: Try to come up with a better syntax. Most other patterns visually
reflect what values they *do* match, and using `?` for null-checks does the
exact *opposite*: it looks like the values it *refutes*.**

### Null-assert pattern

```
nullAssertPattern ::= unaryPattern '!'
```

A null-assert pattern is similar to a null-check pattern in that it permits
non-null values to flow through. But a null-assert *throws* if the matched
value is null. It lets you forcibly *assert* that you know a value shouldn't
be null, much like the corresponding `!` null-assert expression.

This lets you eliminate null in variable declarations where a refutable pattern
isn't allowed:

```dart
(int?, int?) position = ...

// We know if we get here that the coordinates should be present:
var (x!, y!) = position;
```

Or where you don't want null to be silently treated as a match failure, as in:

```dart
List<String?> row = ...

// If the first column is 'user', we expect to have a name after it.
if (var ['user', name!] = row) {
  // name is a non-nullable string here.
}
```

### Literal pattern

```
literalPattern ::= booleanLiteral | nullLiteral | numericLiteral | stringLiteral

```

A literal pattern determines if the value is equivalent to the given literal
value. There are no list and map *literal* patterns since there are actual list
and map patterns.

**Breaking change**: Using patterns in switch cases means that a list or map
literal in a switch case is now interpreted as a list or map pattern which
destructures its elements at runtime. Before, it was simply treated as identity
comparison.

```dart
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
var obj = [1, 2]; // Not const.

switch (obj) {
  case [a, b]: print("match"); break;
  default: print("no match");
}
```

In Dart today, this prints "no match". With this proposal, it changes to
"match". However, looking at the 22,943 switch cases in 1,000 pub packages
(10,599,303 lines in 34,917 files), I found zero case expressions that were
collection literals.

### Constant pattern

```
constantPattern ::= qualifiedName
```

Like literal patterns, a named constant pattern determines if the matched value
is equal to the constant's value.

Only qualified names can be used as constant patterns. That includes prefixed
constants like `some_library.aConstant`, static constants on classes like
`SomeClass.aConstant`, and prefixed static constants like
`some_library.SomeClass.aConstant`. It does *not* allow references to named
constants that are simple identifiers. Those are ambiguous with variable
patterns and the language resolves the ambiguity by treating it as a variable
pattern:

```dart
void test() {
  const localConstant = 1;
  switch (2) {
    case localConstant: print('matched!');
    default: print('unmatched');
  }
}
```

This prints "matched!" because `localConstant` in the case is interpreted as a
*variable* pattern that matches any value and binds the value to a new variable
with that name. (We should have a lint that warns if you have a variable pattern
whose name is the same as a surrounding constant, because that likely indicates
a mistake.)

**Breaking change:** This is a breaking change for simple identifiers that
appear in existing switch cases. Fortunately, it turns out that most switch
cases are not simple named constants. I analyzed a large corpus of Pub packages
and Flutter apps (13M+ lines in 61,346 files):

```
    -- Case (81469 total) --
  43469 ( 53.356%): literal                   ===================
  34960 ( 42.912%): prefixed.identifier       ===============
   2855 (  3.504%): identifier                ==
    171 (  0.210%): prefixed.property.access  =
      7 (  0.009%): SymbolLiteralImpl         =
      4 (  0.005%): MethodInvocationImpl      = (const ctor calls)
      3 (  0.004%): FunctionReferenceImpl     = (type literals)
```

Named constants are common in switch cases, but most of them are *qualified*
identifiers like `SomeEnum.value` or `prefix.aConstant`. Switches using a simple
identifier are only 3.5% of the cases. Most come from just a couple of packages
and most of those are from using the charcode package. Changing those to use an
import prefix would eliminate most of that already small 3.5%.

In rare cases where you do need a pattern to refer to a named constant with a
simple identifier name, you can use an explicit `==` pattern:

```dart
void test() {
  const localConstant = 1;
  switch (2) {
    case == localConstant: print('matched!');
    default: print('unmatched');
  }
}
```

This prints "unmatched".

**TODO: We should add a lint that warns if a variable pattern shadows an
in-scope constant since it's likely a mistaken attempt to match the constant.**

### Variable pattern

```
variablePattern ::= type? identifier
```

A variable pattern binds the matched value to a new variable. These usually
occur as subpatterns of a destructuring pattern in order to capture a
destructured value.

```dart
var (a, b) = (1, 2);
```

Here, `a` and `b` are variable patterns and end up bound to `1` and `2`,
respectively.

The pattern may also have a type annotation in order to only match values of the
specified type. If the type annotation is omitted, the variable's type is
inferred and the pattern matches all values.

```dart
if ((int x, String s) = record) {
  print('First field is int $x and second is String $s.');
}
```

#### Wildcards

If the variable's name is `_`, it doesn't bind any variable. This "wildcard"
name is useful as a placeholder in places where you need a subpattern in order
to destructure later positional values:

```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var [_, two, _] = list;
```

The `_` identifier can also be used with a type annotation when you want to test
a value's type but not bind the value to a name:

```dart
if ((int _, String _) = record) {
  print('First field is int and second is String.');
}
```

### Cast pattern

```
castPattern ::= identifier 'as' type
```

A cast pattern is similar to a variable pattern in that it binds a new variable
to the matched value with a given type. But where a variable pattern is
*refuted* if the value doesn't have that type, a cast pattern *throws*. Like the
null-assert pattern, this lets you forcibly assert the expected type of some
destructured value. This isn't useful as the outermost pattern in a declaration
since you can always move the `as` to the initializer expression:

```dart
num n = 1;
var i as int = n; // Instead of this...
var i = n as int; // ...do this.
```

But when destructuring, there is no place in the initializer to insert the cast.
This pattern lets you insert the cast as values are being pulled out by the
pattern:

```dart
(num, Object) record = (1, "s");
var (i as int, s as String) = record;
```

### Parenthesized pattern

```
parenthesizedPattern ::= '(' pattern ')'
```

Like parenthesized expressions, parentheses in a pattern let you control pattern
precedence and insert a lower precedence pattern where a higher precedence one
is expected.

### List pattern

```
listPattern ::= typeArguments? '[' patterns? ']'
```

A list pattern matches an object that implements `List` and extracts elements by
position from it.

It is a compile-time error if `typeArguments` is present and has more than one
type argument.

**TODO: Allow a `...` element in order to match suffixes or ignore extra
elements. Allow capturing the rest in a variable.**

### Map pattern

```
mapPattern        ::= typeArguments? '{' mapPatternEntries? '}'
mapPatternEntries ::= mapPatternEntry ( ',' mapPatternEntry )* ','?
mapPatternEntry   ::= expression ':' pattern
```

A map pattern matches values that implement `Map` and accesses values by key
from it.

It is a compile-time error if:

*   `typeArguments` is present and there are more or fewer than two type
    arguments.

*   Any of the entry key expressions are not constant expressions.

*   If any two keys in the map both have primitive `==` methods, then it is a
    compile-time error if they are equal according to their `==` operator. *In
    cases where keys have types whose equality can be checked at compile time,
    we report errors if there are redundant keys. But we don't require the keys
    to have primitive equality for flexibility. In map patterns where the keys
    don't have primitive equality, it is possible to have redundant keys and the
    compiler won't detect it.*

### Record pattern

```
recordPattern         ::= '(' patternFields? ')'
patternFields         ::= patternField ( ',' patternField )* ','?
patternField          ::= ( identifier? ':' )? pattern
```

A record pattern matches a record object and destructures its fields. If the
value isn't a record with the same shape as the pattern, then the match fails.
Otherwise, the field subpatterns are matched against the corresponding fields in
the record.

Field subpatterns can be in one of three forms:

*   A bare `pattern` destructures the corresponding positional field from the
    record and matches it against `pattern`.

*   A `identifier: pattern` destructures the named field with the name
    `identifier` and matches it against `pattern`.

*   A `: pattern` is a named field with the name omitted. When destructuring
    named fields, it's very common to want to bind the resulting value to a
    variable with the same name. As a convenience, the identifier can be omitted
    on a named field. In that case, the name is inferred from `pattern`. The
    subpattern must be a variable pattern or cast pattern, which may be wrapped
    in any number of null-check or null-assert patterns.

    The field name is then inferred from the name in the variable or cast
    pattern. These pairs of patterns are each equivalent:

    ```dart
    // Variable:
    (untyped: untyped, typed: int typed)
    (:untyped, :int typed)

    // Null-check and null-assert:
    (checked: checked?, asserted: asserted!)
    (:checked?, :asserted!)

    // Cast:
    (field: field as int)
    (:field as int)
    ```

A record pattern with a single unnamed field and no trailing comma is ambiguous
with a parenthesized pattern. In that case, it is treated as a parenthesized
pattern. To write a record pattern that matches a single unnamed field, add a
trailing comma, as you would with the corresponding record expression.

### Extractor pattern

```
extractorPattern ::= extractorName typeArguments? '(' patternFields? ')'
extractorName    ::= typeIdentifier | qualifiedName
```

An extractor matches values of a given named type and then extracts values from
it by calling getters on the value. Extractor patterns let users destructure
data from arbitrary objects using the getters the object's class already
exposes.

This pattern is particularly useful for writing code in an algebraic datatype
style. For example:

```dart
class Rect {
  final double width, height;

  Rect(this.width, this.height);
}

display(Object obj) {
  switch (obj) {
    case Rect(width: w, height: h): print('Rect $w x $h');
    default: print(obj);
  }
}
```

It is a compile-time error if:

*   `extractorName` does not refer to a type.

*   A type argument list is present and does not match the arity of the type of
    `extractorName`.

*   A `patternField` is of the form `pattern`. Positional fields aren't allowed.

As with record patterns, the getter name can be omitted in which case it is
inferred from the variable or cast pattern in the field subpattern, which may be
wrapped in null-check or null-assert patterns. The previous example could be
written like:

```dart
display(Object obj) {
  switch (obj) {
    case Rect(:width, :height): print('Rect $width x $height');
    default: print(obj);
  }
}
```

## Pattern uses

Patterns are woven into the larger language in a few ways:

### Pattern variable declaration

Places in the language where a local variable can be declared are extended to
allow a pattern, like:

```dart
var (a, [b, c]) = ("str", [1, 2]);
```

Dart's existing C-style variable declaration syntax makes it harder to
incorporate patterns. Variables can be declared just by writing their type, and
a single declaration might declare multiple variables. Fully incorporating
patterns into that could lead to confusing syntax like:

```dart
// Not allowed:
(int, String) (n, s) = (1, "str");
final (a, b) = (1, 2), c = 3, (d, e);
```

To avoid this weirdness, patterns only occur in variable declarations that begin
with a `var` or `final` keyword. Also, a variable declaration using a pattern
can only have a single declaration "section". No comma-separated multiple
declarations like:

```dart
// Not allowed:
var [a] = [1], (b, c) = (2, 3);
```

Declarations with patterns must have an initializer. This is not a limitation
since the point of using a pattern in a variable declaration is to match it
against the initializer's value.

Add this new rule:

```
patternDeclaration  ::= ( 'final' | 'var' ) outerPattern '=' expression

outerPattern        ::= nullCheckPattern
                      | parenthesizedPattern
                      | listPattern
                      | mapPattern
                      | recordPattern
                      | extractorPattern
```

The `outerPattern` rule defines a subset of the patterns that are allowed as the
outermost pattern in a declaration. Subsetting allows useful code like:

```dart
var [a, b] = [1, 2];                  // List.
var {1: a} = {1: 2};                  // Map.
var (a, b, x: x) = (1, 2, x: 3);      // Record.
var Point(x: x, y: y) = Point(1, 2);  // Extractor.
if (var string? = nullableString) ... // Null-check.
```

But excludes other kinds of patterns to prohibit weird code like:

```dart
// Not allowed:
var String str = 'redundant';     // Variable.
var str as String = 'weird';      // Cast.
var definitely! = maybe;          // Null-assert.
```

Allowing parentheses gives users an escape hatch if they really want to use an
unusual pattern there.

**TODO: Should we support destructuring in `const` declarations?**

The new rules are incorporated into the existing productions for declaring
variables like so:

```
localVariableDeclaration ::=
  | initializedVariableDeclaration ';' // Existing.
  | patternDeclaration ';' // New.

forLoopParts ::=
  | // Existing productions...
  | ( 'final' | 'var' ) outerPattern 'in' expression // New.
```

As with regular for-in loops, it is a compile-time error if the type of
`expression` in a pattern-for-in loop is not assignable to `Iterable<dynamic>`.

*This could potentially be extended to allow patterns in top-level variables and
static fields but laziness makes that more complex. We could support patterns in
instance field declarations, but constructor initializer lists make that harder.
Parameter lists are a natural place to allow patterns, but the existing grammar
complexity of parameter lists&mdash;optional parameters, named parameters,
required parameters, default values, etc.&mdash;make that very hard. For the
initial proposal, we focus on patterns only in variables with local scope.*

### Pattern assignment

A pattern on the left side of an assignment expression is used to destructure
the assigned value. We extend `expression`:

```
expression        ::= patternAssignment
                    | // Existing productions...

patternAssignment ::= outerPattern '=' expression
```

*This syntax allows chaining pattern assignments and mixing them with other
assignments, but does not allow patterns to the left of a compound assignment
operator.*

In a pattern assignment, all variable and cast patterns are interpreted as
referring to existing variables or setters. You can't declare any new variables.
*Disallowing new variables allows pattern assignment expressions to appear
anywhere expressions are allowed while avoiding confusion about the scope of new
variables.*

It is a compile-time error if:

*   A variable pattern has a type annotation. *Only simple identifiers are
    allowed since you aren't declaring a new variable.*

*   An identifier in a variable or cast pattern does not resolve to a non-final
    variable or setter.

*   The matched value type for a variable or cast pattern is not assignable to
    the corresponding variable or setter's type.

*   The same variable is assigned more than once. *In other words, a pattern
    assignment can't have multiple variable or cast subpatterns with the same
    name. This prohibits code like:*

    ```dart
    var a = 1;
    (a & a) = 2;
    [a, a, a] = [1, 2, 3];
    ```

### Switch statement

We extend switch statements to allow patterns in cases:

```
switchStatement ::= 'switch' '(' expression ')' '{' switchCase* defaultCase? '}'
switchCase      ::= label* caseHead ':' statements
caseHead        ::= 'case' pattern ( 'when' expression )?
```

Allowing patterns in cases significantly increases the expressiveness of what
properties a case can verify, including executing arbitrary user-defined code.
This implies that the order that cases are checked is now potentially
user-visible and an implementation must execute the *first* case that matches.

#### Guard clause

We also allow an optional *guard clause* to appear after a case. This enables a
switch case to evaluate an arbitrary predicate after matching. Guards are useful
because when the predicate evaluates to false, execution proceeds to the next
case instead of exiting the entire switch like it would if you nested an `if`
statement inside the switch case's body:

```dart
var pair = (1, 2);

// This prints nothing:
switch (pair) {
  case (a, b):
    if (a > b) print('First element greater');
    break;
  case (a, b):
    print('Other order');
    break;
}

// This prints "Other order":
switch (pair) {
  case (a, b) when a > b:
    print('First element greater');
    break;
  case (a, b):
    print('Other order');
    break;
}
```

**TODO: Consider using `if (...)` instead of `when ...` for guards so that
we don't need a contextual keyword.**

#### Implicit break

A long-running annoyance with switch statements is the mandatory `break`
statements at the end of each case body. Dart does not allow fallthrough, so
these `break` statements have no real effect. They exist so that Dart code does
not *appear* to be doing fallthrough to users coming from languages like C that
do allow it. That is a high syntactic tax for limited benefit.

I inspected the 25,014 switch cases in the most recent 1,000 packages on pub
(10,599,303 LOC). 26.40% of the statements in them are `break`. 28.960% of the
cases contain only a *single* statement followed by a `break`. This means
`break` is a fairly large fraction of the statements in all switches even though
it does nothing.

Therefore, this proposal removes the requirement that each non-empty case body
definitely exit. Instead, a non-empty case body implicitly jumps to the end of
the switch after completion. From the spec, remove:

> If *s* is a non-empty block statement, let *s* instead be the last statement
> of the block statement. It is a compile-time error if *s* is not a `break`,
> `continue`, `rethrow` or `return` statement or an expression statement where
> the expression is a `throw` expression.

This is now valid code that prints "one":

```dart
switch (1) {
  case 1:
    print("one");
  case 2:
    print("two");
}
```

Empty cases continue to fallthrough to the next case as before. This prints "one
or two":

```dart
switch (1) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    print("one or two");
}
```

### Switch expression

When you want an `if` statement in an expression context, you can use a
conditional expression (`?:`). There is no expression form for multi-way
branching, so we define a new switch expression. It takes code like this:

```dart
Color shiftHue(Color color) {
  switch (color) {
    case Color.red:
      return Color.orange;
    case Color.orange:
      return Color.yellow;
    case Color.yellow:
      return Color.green;
    case Color.green:
      return Color.blue;
    case Color.blue:
      return Color.purple;
    case Color.purple:
      return Color.red;
  }
}
```

And turns it into:

```dart
Color shiftHue(Color color) {
  return switch (color) {
    case Color.red => Color.orange;
    case Color.orange => Color.yellow;
    case Color.yellow => Color.green;
    case Color.green => Color.blue;
    case Color.blue => Color.purple;
    case Color.purple => Color.red;
  };
}
```

The grammar is:

```
primary               ::= // Existing productions...
                        | switchExpression

switchExpression      ::= 'switch' '(' expression ')' '{'
                          switchExpressionCase* defaultExpressionCase? '}'
switchExpressionCase  ::= caseHead '=>' expression ';'
defaultExpressionCase ::= 'default' '=>' expression ';'
```

Slotting into `primary` means it can be used anywhere any expression can appear,
even as operands to unary and binary operators. Many of these uses are ugly, but
not any more problematic than using a collection literal in the same context
since a `switch` expression is always delimited by a `switch` and `}`.

Making it high precedence allows useful patterns like:

```dart
await switch (n) {
  case 1 => aFuture;
  case 2 => anotherFuture;
  default => otherwiseFuture;
};

var x = switch (n) {
  case 1 => obj;
  case 2 => another;
  default => otherwise;
}.someMethod();
```

Over half of the switch cases in a large corpus of packages contain either a
single return statement or an assignment followed by a break so there is some
evidence this will be useful.

#### Expression statement ambiguity

Thanks to expression statements, a switch expression could appear in the same
position as a switch statement. This isn't technically ambiguous, but requires
unbounded lookahead to tell if a switch in statement position is a statement or
expression.

```dart
main() {
  switch (some(extremely, long, expression, here)) {
    case Some(Quite(var long, var pattern)) => expression();
  };

  switch (some(extremely, long, expression, here)) {
    case Some(Quite(var long, var pattern)) : statement();
  }
}
```

To avoid that, we disallow a switch expression from appearing at the beginning
of an expression statement. This is similar to existing restrictions on map
literals appearing in expression statements. In the rare case where a user
really wants one there, they can parenthesize it.

**TODO: If we change switch expressions [to use `:` instead of `=>`][2126] then
there will be an actual ambiguity. In that case, reword the above section.**

[2126]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2126

### Pattern-if statement

Often you want to conditionally match and destructure some data, but you only
want to test a value against a single pattern. You can use a `switch` statement
for that, but it's pretty verbose:

```dart
switch (json) {
  case [int x, int y]:
    return Point(x, y);
}
```

We can make simple uses like this a little cleaner by allowing a pattern
variable declaration in place of an if condition:

```dart
if (var [int x, int y] = json) return Point(x, y);
```

It may have an else branch as well:

```dart
if (var [int x, int y] = json) {
  print('Was coordinate array $x,$y');
} else {
  throw FormatException('Invalid JSON.');
}
```

We replace the existing `ifStatement` rule with:

```
ifStatement ::= 'if' '(' ifCondition ')' statement ('else' statement)?

ifCondition ::= expression // Existing if statement condition.
              | patternDeclaration
              | type identifier '=' expression
```

**TODO: Allow patterns in if elements too.**

When the `ifCondition` is an `expression`, it behaves as it does today. If the
condition is a `patternDeclaration`, then the expression is evaluated and
matched against the pattern. If it matches, then branch is executed with any
variables the pattern defines in scope. Otherwise, the else branch is executed
if there is one. The third form of `ifCondition` allows simple typed variable
declarations inside the condition:

```dart
num n = ...
if (int i = n) print('$n is an integer $i');
```

This behaves like a typed variable pattern. *We don't allow a typed variable
pattern to appear in `patternDeclaration` to avoid a redundant `var int x`
syntax.*

Unlike `switch`, the pattern-if statement doesn't allow a guard clause. Guards
are important in switch cases because, unlike nesting an if statement *inside*
the switch case, a failed guard will continue to try later cases in the switch.
That is less important here since the only other case is the else branch.

## Static semantics

### Refutable and irrefutable patterns and contexts

Patterns appear inside a number of other constructs in the language. This
proposal extends Dart to allow patterns in:

* Local variable declarations.
* For loop variable declarations.
* Assignment expressions.
* Switch statement cases.
* A new switch expression form's cases.
* A new pattern-if statement.

When a pattern appears in a switch case, any variables bound by the pattern are
only in scope in that case's body. If the pattern fails to match, the case body
is skipped. This ensures that the variables can't be used when the pattern
failed to match and they have no defined value. Likewise, the variables bound by
a pattern-if statement's pattern are only in scope in the then branch. That
branch is skipped if the pattern fails to match.

When patterns appear in variable declarations and assignments, there is no
natural control flow that can skip over uses of the variables if the pattern
fails to match. For example:

```dart
main() {
  var (a, 5) = (1, 2);
  print(a + b);
}
```

What happens when `a` is printed in the example above?

To avoid that, we restrict which patterns can be used in variable declarations
and pattern assignments. Only *irrefutable* patterns that never fail to match
are allowed in contexts where match failure can't be handled. Since a literal
pattern like `5` in the above example might fail to match, it's prohibited and
the above example has a compile error.

We define an *irrefutable context* as the pattern in a
`localVariableDeclaration`, `forLoopParts`, or `patternAssignment` or any of its
subpatterns. It is a compile-time error if any of these patterns appear in an
irrefutable context:

*   Logical-or
*   Relational
*   Null-check
*   Literal
*   Constant

*Logical-or patterns are refutable because there is no point in using one with
an irrefutable left operand. We could make null-check patterns irrefutable if
`V` is assignable to its static type, but whenever that is true the pattern does
nothing useful since its only behavior is a type test.*

*The remaining patterns are allowed syntactically to appear in a refutable
context. Patterns that do type tests like variables and lists produce a
compile-time error when used in an irrefutable context if the matched value
isn't assignable to their required type. This error is specified under type
checking.*

### Type inference

Type inference in Dart allows type information in one part of the program to
flow over and fill in missing pieces in another part. Inference can flow
"upwards" from a subexpression to the surrounding expression:

```dart
[1]
```

Here, we infer `List<int>` for the type of the list literal based on type of its
element. Inference can flow "downwards" from an expression into its
subexpressions too:

```dart
<List<int>>[[]]
```

Here, the inner empty list literal `[]` gets type `List<int>` because the type
argument on the outer list literal is pushed into it.

Type information can flow through patterns in the same way. From subpatterns
upwards to the surrounding pattern:

```dart
var [int x] = ...
```

Here, we infer `List<int>` for the list pattern based on the type of the element
subpattern. Or downwards:

```dart
var <int>[x] = ...
```

Here, we infer `int` for the inner `x` subpattern based on the type of the
surrounding list pattern.

In variable declarations, type information can also flow between the variable
and its initializer. "Upwards" from initializer to variable:

```dart
var x = 1;
```

Here we infer `int` for `x` based on the initializer expression's type. That
upwards flow extends to patterns:

```dart
var [x] = <int>[1];
```

Here, we infer `List<int>` for the list pattern (and thus `int` for the `x`
subpattern) based on type of the initializer expression `<int>[1]`.

Types can also flow "downwards" from variable to initializer:

```dart
List<int> x = [];
```

Here, the empty list is instantiated as `List<int>` because the type annotation
on `x` gets pushed over to the initializer. That extends to patterns:

```dart
var <num>[x] = [1];
```

Here, we infer the list literal in the initializer to have type `List<num>` (and
not `List<int>`) based on the type of list pattern. All of this type flow can be
combined:

```dart
var (a, b, <double>[c], [int d]) = ([1], <List<int>>[[]], [2], [3]);
```

To orchestrate this, type inference on patterns proceeds in three phases:

1.  **Calculate the pattern type schema.** Start at the top of the pattern and
    recurse downwards into subpatterns using the surrounding pattern as context.
    When we reach the leaves, work back upwards filling in missing pieces where
    possible. When this completes, we have a type schema for the pattern. It's
    a type *schema* and not a *type* because there may be holes where types
    aren't known yet.

2.  **Calculate the static type of the matched value.** A pattern always occurs
    in the context of some matched value. For pattern variable declarations,
    this is the initializer. For switches and if-case statements, it's the value
    being matched.

    Using the pattern's type schema as a context type, infer missing types on
    the value expression. This is the existing type inference rules on
    expressions. It yields a complete static type for the matched value.

3.  **Calculate the static type of the pattern.** Using that value type, recurse
    through the pattern again downwards to the leaf subpatterns filling in any
    holes in the type schema. When that completes, we now have a full static
    type for the pattern and all of its subpatterns.

The full process only comes into play for pattern variable declarations, pattern
assignment, and pattern-if statements. For switch cases, there is a separate
pattern for each case and deciding how to unify those into a single downwards
inference context for the value could be challenging. It's not clear that doing
that would even be helpful for users. Instead, for switch statements and
expressions, the type of the matched value is inferred with no downwards context
type and we jump straight to inferring the types of the case patterns from that
context type.

#### Pattern context type schema

In a non-pattern variable declaration, the variable's type annotation is used
for downwards inference of the initializer:

```dart
List<int> list = []; // Infer <int>[].
```

Patterns extend this behavior:

```dart
var (List<int> list, <num>[a]) = ([], [1]); // Infer (<int>[], <num>[]).
```

To support this, every pattern has a context type schema which is used as the
downwards inference context on the matched value expression in pattern variable
declarations and pattern-if statements. This is a type *schema* because there
may be holes in the type:

```dart
var (a, int b) = ... // Schema is `(?, int)`.
```

The context type schema for a pattern `p` is:

*   **Logical-or**: The least upper bound of the context type schemas of the
    branches.

*   **Logical-and**: The greatest lower bound of the context type schemas of the
    branches.

    **TODO: Figure out if LUB and GLB are defined for type schemas.**

*   **Null-check** or **null-assert**: A context type schema `E?` where `E` is
    the context type schema of the inner pattern. *For example:*

    ```dart
    var [[int x]!] = [[]]; // Infers List<List<int>?> for the list literal.
    ```

*   **Literal** or **constant**: The context type schema is the static type of
    the pattern's constant value expression.

*   **Variable**:

    1.  If `p` has no type annotation, the context type schema is `?`.
        *This lets us potentially infer the variable's type from the matched
        value.*

    2.  Else the context type schema is the annotated type. *When a typed
        variable pattern is used in a destructuring variable declaration, we
        do push the type over to the value for inference, as in:*

        ```dart
        var (items: List<int> x) = (items: []);
        //                                 ^- Infers List<int>.
        ```

*   **Relational** or **cast**: The context type schema is `Object?`.

*   **Parenthesized**: The context type schema of the inner subpattern.

*   **List**: A context type schema `List<E>` where:

    1.  If `p` has a type argument, then `E` is the type argument.

    2.  Else if `p` has no elements then `E` is `Object?`. *If the pattern
        doesn't destructure anything, it matches any list, so it is permissive
        with the context type.*

    3.  Else `E` is the greatest lower bound of the type schemas of all element
        subpatterns. *We use the greatest lower bound to ensure that the outer
        collection type has a precise enough type to ensure that any typed field
        subpatterns do not need to downcast:*

        ```dart
        var [int a, num b] = [1, 2];
        ```

        *Here, the GLB of `int` and `num` is `int`, which ensures that neither
        `int a` nor `num b` need to downcast their respective fields.*

*   **Map**: A type schema `Map<K, V>` where:

    1.  If `p` has type arguments then `K`, and `V` are those type arguments.

    2.  Else if `p` has no entries, then `K` and `V` are `Object?`. *If the
        pattern doesn't destructure anything, it matches any map, so it is
        permissive with the context type.*

    3.  Else `K` is the least upper bound of the types of all key expressions
        and `V` is the greatest lower bound of the context type schemas of all
        value subpatterns.

*   **Record**: A record type schema with positional and named fields
    corresponding to the type schemas of the corresponding field subpatterns.

*   **Extractor**: The type the extractor name resolves to. *This lets inference
    fill in type arguments in the value based on the extractor's type arguments,
    as in:*

    ```dart
    var Foo<num>() = Foo();
    //                  ^-- Infer Foo<num>.
    ```

#### Type checking and pattern required type

Once the value a pattern is matched against has a static type (which means
downwards inference on it using the pattern's context type schema is complete),
we can type check the pattern.

Also variable, list, map, record, and extractor patterns only match a value of a
certain *required type*. These patterns are prohibited in an irrefutable context
if the matched value isn't assignable to that type. We define the required type
for those patterns here. Some examples and the corresponding required types:

```dart
var <int>[a, b] = <num>[1, 2];  // List<int> (and compile error).
var [a, b] = <num>[1, 2];       // List<num>, a is num, b is num.
var [int a, b] = <num>[1, 2];   // List<num>.
```

To type check a pattern `p` being matched against a value of type `M`:

*   **Logical-or** and **logical-and**: Type check each branch using `M` as the
    matched value type.

*   **Relational**: If the operator is a comparison (`<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`),
    then it is a compile-time error if `M` does not define that operator, if the
    type of the constant in the relational pattern is not assignable to the
    operator's parameter type, or if the operator's return type is not `bool` or
    `dynamic`. *The `==` and `!=` operators are valid for all pairs of types.*

*   **Null-check** or **null-assert**:

    1.  Let `N` be [**NonNull**][nonnull](`M`).

    2.  Type-check the subpattern using `N` as the matched value type.

    [nonnull]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/2.12/nnbd/feature-specification.md#null-promotion

*   **Literal** or **constant**: Type check the pattern's value expression in
    context type `M`. *The context type comes into play for things like type
    arguments and int-to-double:*

    ```dart
    double d = 1.0;
    switch (d) {
      case 1: ...
    }
    ```

    *Here, the `1` literal pattern in the case is inferred in a context type of
    `double` to be `1.0` and so does match.*

*   **Variable**:

    1.  If the variable has a type annotation, the type of `p` is that type.

    2.  Else the type of `p` is `M`. *This means that an untyped variable
        pattern can have its type indirectly inferred from the type of a
        superpattern:*

        ```dart
        var <(num, Object)>[(a, b)] = [(1, true)]; // a is num, b is Object.
        ```

        *The pattern's context type schema is `List<(num, Object>)`. Downwards
        inference uses that to infer `List<(num, Object>)` for the initializer.
        That inferred type is then destructured and used to infer `num` for `a`
        and `Object` for `b`.*

*   **Cast**: Nothing to do.

*   **Parenthesized**: Type-check the inner subpattern using `M` as the matched
    value type.

*   **List**:

    1.  Calculate the value's element type `E`:

        1.  If `M` implements `List<T>` for some `T` then `E` is `T`.

        2.  Else if `M` is `dynamic` then `E` is `dynamic`.

        3.  Else `E` is `Object?`.

    2.  Type-check each element subpattern using `E` as the matched value type.
        *Note that we calculate a single element type and use it for all
        subpatterns. In:*

        ```dart
        var [a, b] = [1, 2.3];
        ```

        *both `a` and `b` use `num` as their matched value type.*

    3.  The required type of `p` is `List<S>` where:

        1.  If `p` has a type argument, `S` is that type. *If the list pattern
            has an explicit type argument, that wins.*

        2.  Else `S` is `E`. *Otherwise, infer the type from the matched value.*

*   **Map**:

    1.  Calculate the value's entry key type `K` and value type `V`:

        1.  If `M` implements `Map<K, V>` for some `K` and `V` then use those.

        2.  Else if `M` is `dynamic` then `K` and `V` are `dynamic`.

        3.  Else `K` and `V` are `Object?`.

    2.  Type-check each value subpattern using `V` as the matched value type.
        *Like lists, we calculate a single value type and use it for all value
        subpatterns:*

        ```dart
        var {1: a, 2: b} = {1: "str", 2: bool};
        ```

        *Here, both `a` and `b` use `Object` as the matched value type.*

    3.  The required type of `p` is `Map<L, W>` where:

        1.  If `p` has type arguments, `L` and `W` are those type arguments.
            *If the map pattern is explicitly typed, that wins.*

        2.  Else `L` is `K` and `W` is `V`.

*   **Record**:

    1.  Type-check each of `f`'s positional field subpatterns using the
        corresponding positional field type on `M` as the matched value type or
        `Object?` if `M` is not a record type with the corresponding field. *The
        field subpattern will only be matched at runtime if the value does turn
        out to be a record with the right shape where the field is present, so
        it's safe to just assume the field exists when type checking here.*

    2.  Type check each of `f`'s named field subpatterns using the type of the
        corresponding named field on `M` as the matched value type or `Object?`
        if `M` is not a record type with the corresponding field.

    3.  The required type of `p` is a record type with the same shape as `p` and
        `Object?` for all fields. *If the matched value's type is `dynamic` or
        some record supertype like `Object`, then the record pattern should
        match any record with the right shape and then delegate to its field
        subpatterns to ensure that the fields match.*

*   **Extractor**:

    1.  Resolve the extractor name to a type `X`. It is a compile-time error if
        the name does not refer to a type. Apply downwards inference from `M`
        to infer type arguments for `X` if needed.

    1.  Type-check each of `f`'s field subpatterns using the type of the getter
        on `X` with the same name as the field as the matched value type. It is
        a compile-time error if `X` does not have a getter whose name matches
        the subpattern's field name.

    2.  The required type of `p` is `X`.

It is a compile-time error if:

*   The type of an expression in a guard clause is not `bool` or `dynamic`.

*   `p` is in an irrefutable context, it has a required type `T`, and `M` is not
    assignable to `T`. *Destructuring and variable patterns can only be used in
    declarations and assignments if we can statically tell that the
    destructuring and variable binding won't fail.*

### Switch expression type

The static type of a switch expression is the least upper bound of the static
types of all of the case expressions.

### Variables and scope

Patterns often exist to introduce new variable bindings. A "wildcard" identifier
named `_` in a variable or cast pattern never introduces a binding.

The variables a patterns binds depend on what kind of pattern it is:

*   **Logical-or**: Does not introduce variables but may contain subpatterns
    that do. If it a compile-time error if the two subpatterns do not introduce
    the same variables with the same names and types.

*   **Logical-and**, **null-check**, **null-assert**, **parenthesized**,
    **list**, **map**, **record**, or **extractor**: These do not introduce
    variables themselves but may contain subpatterns that do.

*   **Relational**, **literal**, or **constant**: These do not introduce any
    variables.

*   **Variable** or **cast**: May contain type argument patterns. Introduces a
    variable whose name is the pattern's identifier. The variable is final if
    the surrounding `patternDeclaration` has a `final` modifier. *Variables in
    switch cases don't occur inside pattern variable declarations and thus are
    not final.*

The scope where a pattern's variables are declared depends on the construct
that contains the pattern:

*   **Local pattern variable declaration**: The rest of the block following
    the declaration.
*   **For loop pattern variable declaration**: The body of the loop and the
    condition and increment clauses in a C-style for loop.
*   **Switch statement case**: The guard clause and the statements of the
    subsequent non-empty case body.
*   **Switch expression case**: The guard clause and the case expression.
*   **Pattern-if statement**: The then statement.

Multiple switch case patterns may share the same variable scope if their case
bodies are empty:

```dart
switch (obj) {
  case [int a, int b]:
  case {"a": int a, "b": int b}:
    print(a + b); // OK.

  case [int a]:
  case (String a): // Error.
    break;
}
```

This would normally be a name collision, but we make an exception to allow this.
However, it is a compile-time error if all switch case patterns that share a
body do not all define the exact same variables with the exact same types.

*Aside from this special case, note that since all variables declared by a
pattern and its subpattern go into the same scope, it is an error if two
subpatterns declare a variable with the same name, unless the name is `_`.*

### Type promotion

**TODO: Specify how pattern matching may show that existing variables have some
type.**

### Exhaustiveness and reachability

A switch is *exhaustive* if all possible values of the matched value's type will
definitely match at least one case, or there is a default case. Dart currently
shows a warning if a switch statement on an enum type does not have cases for
all enum values (or a default). This is helpful for code maintainance: when you
add a new value to an enum type, the language shows you every switch statement
that may need a new case to handle it.

This checking is even more important with this proposal. Exhaustiveness checking
is a key part of maintaining code written in an algebraic datatype style. It's
the functional equivalent of the error reported when a concrete class fails to
implement an abstract method.

Exhaustiveness checking over arbitrarily deeply nested record and extractor
patterns can be complex, so the proposal for that is in a [separate
document][exhaustiveness].

## Runtime semantics

### Execution

Most of the runtime behavior is defined in the "matching" section below, but
the constructs where patterns appear have their own (hopefully obvious)
behavior.

#### Pattern variable declaration

1.  Evaluate the initializer expression producing a value `v`.

2.  Match `v` against the declaration's pattern.

#### Pattern assignment

1.  Evaluate the right-hand side expression to a value `v`.

2.  Match `v` against the pattern on the left. When matching a variable or cast
    pattern against a value `o`, record that `o` will be the new value for the
    corresponding variable/setter, but do not store the variable or invoke the
    setter.

3.  Once all destructuring and matching is done, store all of the assigned
    variables and invoke the setters with their corresponding values. Invoke
    setters in the order that the corresponding patterns appear, from left to
    right.

*In other words, it's as if every variable or cast pattern in an assignment
expression is a new variable declaration with a hidden name. Then after the
assignment expression and matching completes, those temporary variables are all
written to the corresponding real variables and setters. We defer the storage
until matching has completed so that users never see a partial assignment if
matching happens to fail in some way.*

#### Switch statement

1.  Evaluate the switch value producing `v`.

2.  For each case:

    1.  Match the case's pattern against `v`. If the match fails then continue
        to the next case (or default clause or exit the switch if there are no
        other cases).

    2.  If there is a guard clause, evaluate it. If it does not evaluate to a
        Boolean, throw a runtime exception. *This can happen if the guard
        expression's type is `dynamic`.* If it evaluates to `false`, continue to
        the next case (or default or exit).

    3.  Execute the nearest non-empty case body at or following this case.
        *You're allowed to have multiple empty cases where all preceding
        ones share the same body with the last case.*

    4.  Exit the switch statement. *An explicit `break` is no longer
        required.*

3.  If no case pattern matched and there is a default clause, execute the
    statements after it.

4.  If no case matches and there is no default clause, throw a runtime
    exception. *This can only occur when `null` or a legacy typed value flows
    into this switch statement from another library that hasn't migrated to
    [null safety][]. In fully migrated programs, exhaustiveness checking is
    sound and it isn't possible to reach this runtime error.*

[null safety]: https://dart.dev/null-safety

#### Switch expression

1.  Evaluate the switch value producing `v`.

2.  For each case:

    1.  Match the case's pattern against `v`. If the match fails then continue
        to the next case (or default clause if there are no other cases).

    2.  If there is a guard clause, evaluate it. If it does not evaluate to
        a Boolean, throw a runtime exception. If it evaluates to `false`,
        continue to the next case (or default clause).

    3.  Evaluate the expression after the case and yield that as the result of
        the entire switch expression.

3.  If no case pattern matched and there is a default clause, execute the
    expression after it and yield that as the result of the entire switch
    expression.

4.  If no case matches and there is no default clause, throw a runtime
    exception. *This can only occur when `null` or a legacy typed value flows
    into this switch expression from another library that hasn't migrated to
    [null safety][]. In fully migrated programs, exhaustiveness checking is
    sound and it isn't possible to reach this runtime error.*

#### Pattern-for statement

A statement of the form:

```dart
for (<patternDeclaration>; <condition>; <increment>) <statement>
```

Is executed similar to a traditional for loop except that multiple variables may
be declared by the pattern instead of just one. As with a normal for loop, those
variables are freshly bound to new values at each iteration so that if a
function closes over a variable, it captures the value at the current iteration
and is not affected by later iteration.

The increment clause is evaluated in a scope where all variables declared in the
pattern are freshly bound to new variables holding the current iteration's
values. If the increment clause assigns to any of the variables declared by the
pattern, those become the values bound to those variables in the next iteration.
For example:

```dart
var fns = <Function()>[];
for (var (a, b) = (0, 1); a <= 13; (a, b) = (b, a + b)) {
  fns.add(() {
    print(a);
  });
}

for (var fn in fns) {
  fn();
}
```

This prints `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`.

#### Pattern-for-in statement

A statement of the form:

```dart
for (<keyword> <pattern> in <expression>) <statement>
```

Where `<keyword>` is `var` or `final` is treated like so:

1.  Let `I` be the type of `<expression>`.

2.  Calculate the element type of `I`:

    1.  If `I` implements `Iterable<T>` for some `T` then `E` is `T`.

    2.  Else if `I` is `dynamic` then `E` is `dynamic`.

    3.  Else it is a compile-time error.

3.  Type check `<pattern>` with matched value type `E`.

4.  If there are no compile-time errors, then execution proceeds as the
    following code, where `id1` and `id2` are fresh identifiers:

    ```
    var id1 = <expression>;
    var id2 = id1.iterator;
    while (id2.moveNext()) {
      <keyword> <pattern> = id2.current;
      { <statement> }
    }
    ```

#### Pattern-if statement

1.  Evaluate the `expression` producing `v`.

2.  Match the `pattern` against `v`.

3.  If the match succeeds, evaluate the then `statement`. Otherwise, if there
    is an `else` clause, evaluate the else `statement`.

### Matching (refuting and destructuring)

At runtime, a pattern is matched against a value. This determines whether or not
the match *fails* and the pattern *refutes* the value. If the match succeeds,
the pattern may also *destructure* data from the object or *bind* variables.

Refutable patterns usually occur in a context where match refutation causes
execution to skip over the body of code where any variables bound by the pattern
are in scope. If a pattern match failure occurs in irrefutable context, a
runtime exception is thrown. *This can happen when matching against a value of
type `dynamic`, or when a list pattern in a variable declaration is matched
against a list of a different length.*

To match a pattern `p` against a value `v`:

*   **Logical-or**:

    1.  Match the left subpattern against `v`. If it matches, the logical-or
        match succeeds.

    2.  Otherwise, match the right subpattern against `v` and succeed if it
        matches.

*   **Logical-and**:

    1.  Match the left subpattern against `v`. If the match fails, the
        logical-and match fails.

    2.  Otherwise, match the right subpattern against `v` and succeed if it
        matches.

*   **Relational**:

    1.  Evaluate the right-hand constant expression to `c`.

    2.  A `== c` pattern matches if `v == c` evaluates to true. *This takes into
        account the built-in semantics that `null` is only equal to `null`.*

    3.  A `!= c` pattern matches if `v == e` evaluates to false. *This takes
        into account the built-in semantics that `null` is not equal to anything
        but `null`.*

    4.  For any other operator, the pattern matches if calling the operator
        method of the same name on the matched value, with `c` as the argument
        returns true.

*   **Null-check**:

    1.  If `v` is null then the match fails.

    2.  Otherwise, match the inner pattern against `v`.

*   **Null-assert**:

    1.  If `v` is null then throw a runtime exception. *Note that we throw even
        if this appears outside of a refutable context. The intent of this
        pattern is to assert that a value *must* not be null.*

    2.  Otherwise, match the inner pattern against `v`.

*   **Literal** or **constant**: The pattern matches if `o == v` evaluates to
    `true` where `o` is the pattern's value.

    **TODO: Should this be `v == o`?**

*   **Variable**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails.

    2.  Otherwise, bind the variable's identifier to `v` and the match succeeds.

*   **Cast**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then throw a runtime exception. *Note that we throw even if this appears
        outside of a refutable context. The intent of this pattern is to assert
        that a value *must* have some type.*

    2.  Otherwise, bind the variable's identifier to `v` and the match succeeds.

*   **Parenthesized**: Match the subpattern against `v` and succeed if it
    matches.

*   **List**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails. *The list pattern's type will be `List<T>` for
        some `T` determined either by the pattern's explicit type argument or
        inferred from the matched value type.*

    2.  If the length of the list determined by calling `length` is not equal to
        the number of subpatterns, then the match fails. *This match failure
        becomes a runtime exception if the list pattern is in a variable
        declaration.*

    3.  Otherwise, for each element subpattern, in source order:

        1.  Extract the element value `e` by calling `[]` on `v` with an
            appropriate integer index.

        2.  Match `e` against the element subpattern.

    4.  The match succeeds if all subpatterns match.

*   **Map**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails. *The map pattern's type will be `Map<K, V>` for
        some `K` and `V` determined either by the pattern's explicit type
        arguments or inferred from the matched value type.*

    2.  If the length of the map determined by calling `length` is not equal to
        the number of subpatterns, then the match fails. *This match failure
        becomes a runtime exception if the map pattern is in a variable
        declaration.*

    3.  Otherwise, for each entry in `p`:

        1.  Evaluate the key `expression` to `k` and call `containsKey()` on the
            value. If this returns `false`, the map does not match.

        2.  Otherwise, evaluate `v[k]` and match the resulting value against
            this entry's value subpattern. If it does not match, the map does
            not match.

    4.  The match succeeds if all entry subpatterns match.

    *Note that, unlike with lists, a matched map may have additional entries
    that are not checked by the pattern.*

*   **Record**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a record type with the same type as
        the static type of `p`, then the match fails.

    2.  For each field `f` in `p`, in source order:

        1.  Access the corresponding field in record `v` as `r`.

        2.  Match the subpattern of `f` against `r`. If the match fails, the
            record match fails.

    3.  The match succeeds if all field subpatterns match.

*   **Extractor**:

    1.  If the runtime type of `v` is not a subtype of the static type of `p`
        then the match fails.

    3.  Otherwise, for each field `f` in `p`:

        1.  Call the getter with the same name as `f` on `v` to a result `r`.

        2.  Match the subpattern of `f` against `r`. If the match fails, the
            extractor match fails.

    3.  The match succeeds if all field subpatterns match.

**TODO: Update to specify that the result of operations can be cached across
cases. See: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2107**

## Severability

This proposal, along with the records and exhaustiveness documents it depends
on, is a lot of new language work. There is new syntax to parse, new type
checking and inference features (including quite complex exhaustiveness
checking), a new kind of object that needs a runtime representation and runtime
type, and new imperative behavior.

It might be too much to fit into a single Dart release. However, it isn't
necessary to ship every corner of these proposals all at once. If needed for
scheduling reasons, we could stage it across several releases.

Here is one way it could be broken down into separate pieces:

*   **Records and destructuring.** Record expressions and record types are one
    of the most-desired aspects of this proposal. Currently, there is no
    expression syntax for accessing positional fields from a record. That means
    we need destructuring. So, at a minimum:

    *   Record expressions and types
    *   Pattern variable declarations
    *   Record patterns
    *   Variable patterns

    This would not include any refutable patterns, so doesn't need the changes
    to allow patterns in switches.

*   **Collection destructuring.** A minor extension of the above is to also
    allow destructuring the other built-in aggregate types:

    *   List patterns
    *   Map patterns

*   **Extractors.** I don't want patterns to feel like we're duct taping a
    functional feature onto an object-oriented language. To integrate it more
    gracefully means destructuring user-defined types too, so adding:

    *   Extractor patterns

*   **Refutable patterns.** The next big step is patterns that don't just
    destructure but *match*. The bare minimum refutable patterns and features
    are:

    *   Patterns in switch statement cases
    *   Switch case guards
    *   Exhaustiveness checking
    *   Literal patterns
    *   Constant patterns
    *   Relational patterns (at least `==`)

    The only critical relational pattern is `==` because once we allow patterns
    in switch cases, we lose the ability to have a bare identifier constant in
    a switch case.

*   **Type testing patterns.** The other type-based patterns aren't critical but
    do make patterns more convenient and useful:

    *   Null-check patterns
    *   Null-assert patterns
    *   Cast patterns

*   **Control flow.** Switch statements are heavyweight. If we want to make
    refutable patterns more useful, we eventually want:

    *   Switch expressions
    *   Pattern-if statements

*   **Logical patterns.** If we're going to add `==` patterns, we may as well
    support other Boolean infix operators. And if we're going to support the
    comparison operators, then `&` is useful for numeric ranges. It's weird to
    have `&` without `|` so we may as well do that too (and it's useful for
    switch expressions). Once we have infix patterns precedence comes into play,
    so we need parentheses to control it:

    *   Relational patterns (other than `==`)
    *   Logical-or patterns
    *   Logical-and patterns
    *   Parenthesized patterns

## Changelog

-   Specify the context type for empty list and map patterns (#2441).

-   Define a grammar rule for the outermost patterns in a declaration (#2446).

-   Rename "grouping" patterns to "parenthesized" patterns (#2447).

-   Specify behavior of patterns in for loops (#2448).

-   Make logical-or and null-check patterns always refutable.

### 2.3

-   Specify that switches throw a runtime error if values from legacy libraries
    flow in and break exhaustiveness checking (#2123).

-   Allow empty list, map, and record patterns (#2441).

-   Clarify ambiguity between grouping and record patterns.

### 2.2

-   Make map patterns check length like list patterns do (#2415).

-   Clarify that variables in cases are not final (#2416).

### 2.1

Minor tweaks:

-   Define the static type of switch expressions (#2380).

-   Clarify semantics of runtime type tests (#2385).

-   Allow relational operators whose return type is `dynamic`.

### 2.0

Major redesign of the syntax and minor redesign of the semantics.

-   Unify binder and matcher patterns into a single grammar. Refutable patterns
    are still prohibited outside of contexts where failure can be handled using
    control flow, but the grammar is unified and more patterns can be used in
    the other context. For example, null-assert patterns can be used in switch
    cases.

-   Always treat simple identifiers as variables in patterns, even in switch
    cases.

-   Change the `if (expr case pattern)` syntax to `if (var pattern = expr)`.

-   Change the guard syntax to `when expr`.

-   Record patterns match only record objects. Extractor patterns (which can
    now be used in variable declarations) are the only way to call getters on
    abitrary objects.

-   New patterns for relational operators, `|`, `&`, and `(...)`. Set up a
    precedence hierarchy for patterns.

-   Get rid of explicit wildcard patterns since they're redundant with untyped
    variable patterns named `_`.

-   Don't allow extractor patterns to match enum values. (It doesn't seem that
    well motivated and could be added later if useful.)

-   Remove support for `late` pattern variable declarations, patterns in
    top-level variables, and patterns in fields. The semantics get pretty weird
    and it's not clear that they're worth it.

-   Change the static typing rules significantly in a number of ways.

-   Remove type patterns. They aren't fully baked, are pretty complex, and don't
    seem critical right now. We can always add them as a later extension.

### 1.8

-   Remove declaration matcher from the proposal. It's only a syntactic sugar
    convenience and seems to cause enough confusion that it's not clear if it
    carries its weight. Removing it simplifies the feature some and we can
    always add it in a future version.

-   Remove the `Destructure_n_` interface. Positional record fields can only be
    used to destructure positional fields from actual record objects. (We may
    extend this later.)

-   Revise and clarify how types work in record and extractor patterns.

### 1.7

-   Fix object destructuring examples and clarify that extract matchers support
    the named field destructuring shorthand too ([#2193][]).

[#2193]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2193

### 1.6

-   Change syntax of if-case statement ([#2181][]).

[#2181]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2181

### 1.5

-   Introduce and clarify type inference.

-   The context type schema for a variable matcher is always `Object?`, since
    it's intent is to *match* a type and *cause* the expression to have some
    type.

### 1.4

-   Link to [exhaustiveness][] proposal.

### 1.3

-   Avoid unbounded lookahead with switch expression in an expression statement
    ([#2138][]).

-   Re-introduce rule that `_` is non-binding in all patterns, not just
    wildcards.

[#2138]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2138

### 1.2

-   Add a shorthand for destructuring a named record field to a variable with
    the same name.

-   Add if-case statement.

-   Allow extractor patterns to match enum values.

-   Add null-assert binder `!` and null-check `?` matcher patterns.

### 1.1

-   Copy editing and clean up.

-   Add `nullLiteral` to literal patterns.

-   Add wildcard binder patterns. Remove exception that variable patterns named
    `_` don't bind.

# Primary Constructors

Author: Erik Ernst

Status: Draft

Version: 1.0

Experiment flag: primary-constructors

This document specifies _primary constructors_. This is a feature that allows
one constructor and a set of instance variables to be specified in a concise
form in the header of the declaration. In order to use this feature, the given
constructor must satisfy certain constraints, e.g., it cannot have a body.

A primary constructor can also be declared in the body of a class or
similar declaration, using the modifier `primary`, in which case it can
have an initializer list and a body, and it still has the ability to
introduce instance variable declarations implicitly.

One variant of this feature has been proposed in the [struct proposal][],
several other proposals have appeared elsewhere, and prior art exists in
languages like [Kotlin][kotlin primary constructors] and Scala (with
specification [here][scala primary constructors] and some examples
[here][scala primary constructor examples]). Many discussions about the
feature have taken place in github issues marked with the
[primary-constructors label][].

## Introduction

Primary constructors is a conciseness feature. It does not provide any new
semantics at all. It just allows us to express something which is already
possible in Dart, using a less verbose notation. Consider this sample class
with two fields and a constructor:

```dart
// Current syntax.

class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
```

A primary constructor allows us to define the same class much more
concisely:

```dart
// A declaration with the same meaning, using a primary constructor.

class Point(int x, int y);
```

In the examples below we show the current syntax directly followed by a
declaration using a primary constructor. The meaning of the two class
declarations with the same name is always the same. Of course, we would
have a name clash if we actually put those two declarations into the same
library, so we should read the examples as "you can write this _or_ you can
write that". So the example above would be shown as follows:

```dart
class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}

class Point(int x, int y);
```

These examples will serve as an illustration of the proposed syntax, but
they will also illustrate the semantics of the primary constructor
declarations, because those declarations work exactly the same as the
declarations using the current syntax.

Note that an empty class body, `{}`, can be replaced by `;`.

The basic idea is that a parameter list that occurs just after the class
name specifies both a constructor declaration and a declaration of one
instance variable for each formal parameter in said parameter list.

A primary constructor cannot have a body, and it cannot have an initializer
list (and hence, it cannot have a superinitializer, e.g., `super(...)`, and
it cannot have assertions).

The motivation for these restrictions is that a primary constructor is
intended to be small and easy to read at a glance. If more machinery is
needed then it is always possible to express the same thing as a body
constructor (i.e., any constructor which isn't a primary constructor).

The parameter list uses the same syntax as constructors and other functions
(specified in the grammar by the non-terminal `<formalParameterList>`).

This implies that there is no way to indicate that the instance variable
declarations should have the modifiers `late` or `external` (because formal
parameters cannot have those modifiers). This omission is not seen as a problem
in this proposal: It is always possible to use a normal constructor declaration
and normal instance variable declarations, and it is probably a useful property
that the primary constructor uses a formal parameter syntax which is completely
like that of any other formal parameter list.

Just use a normal declaration and use an initializing formal in a primary
constructor to initialize it from the primary constructor, if needed.  An
`external` instance variable amounts to an `external` getter and an
`external` setter. Such "variables" cannot be initialized by an
initializing formal anyway, so they will just need to be declared using a
normal `external` variable declaration.

```dart
class ModifierClass {
  late int x;
  external double d;
  ModifierClass(this.x);
}

class ModifierClass(this.x) {
  late int x;
  external double d;
}
```

`ModifierClass` as written does not make sense (`x` does not have to be
`late`), but there could be other constructors that do not initialize `x`.

Super parameters can be declared in the same way as in a body constructor:

```dart
class A {
  final int a;
  A(this.a);
}

class B extends A {
  B(super.a);
}

class A(final int a);
class B(super.a) extends A;
```

Next, the constructor can be named, and it can be constant:

```dart
class Point {
  final int x;
  final int y;
  const Point._(this.x, this.y);
}

class const Point._(final int x, final int y);
```

Note that the class header contains syntax that resembles the constructor
declaration, which may be helpful when reading the code.

The modifier `const` could have been placed on the class (`const class`)
rather than on the class name. This proposal puts it on the class name
because the notion of a "constant class" conflicts with with actual
semantics: It is the constructor which is constant because it is able to be
invoked during constant expression evaluation; it can also be invoked at
run time, and there could be other (non-constant) constructors. This means
that it is at least potentially confusing to say that it is a "constant
class", but it is consistent with the rest of the language to say that this
particular primary constructor is a "constant constructor". Hence `class
const Name` rather than `const class Name`.

The modifier `final` on a parameter in a primary constructor has no meaning
for the parameter itself, because there is no scope where the parameter can
be accessed. Hence, this modifier is used to specify that the instance
variable declared by this primary constructor parameter is `final`.

In the case where the constructor is constant, and in the case where the
declaration is an `extension type` or an `enum` declaration, the modifier
`final` on every instance variable is required. Hence, it can be omitted
from the formal parameter in the primary constructor:

```dart
extension type I.name(int x); // Must use a primary constructor.

class Point {
  final int x;
  final int y;
  const Point(this.x, this.y);
}

class const Point(int x, int y);

enum E {
  one('a'),
  two('b');

  final String s;
  const E(this.s);
}

enum E(String s) { one('a'), two('b') }
```

This mechanism follows an existing pattern, where `const` modifiers can be
omitted in the case where the immediately syntactic context implies that
this modifier _must_ be present. For example, `const [const C()]` can be
written as `const [C()]`. In the examples above, the parameter-and-variable
declarations `final int x` and `final int y` are written as `int x` and
`int y`, and this is allowed because it would be a compile-time error to
omit `final` in an `extension type`, and in a class with a constant
constructor. In other words, when we see an `extension type` declaration, or we
see `const` on the name of a class, we know that `final` is implied on all
instance variables.

Optional parameters can be declared as usual in a primary constructor, with
default values that must be constant as usual:

```dart
class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  Point(this.x, [this.y = 0]);
}

class Point(int x, [int y = 0]);
```

Similarly for named parameters, required or not:

```dart
class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  Point(this.x, {required this.y});
}

class Point(int x, {required int y});
```

In this declaration it is possible to omit the modifier `required` on the
named parameter `y`, because it is implied by the fact that the type of `y`
is non-nullable (potentially non-nullable is enough).

The current scope for the default values in the primary constructor is the
enclosing library scope. This means that a naive copy/paste operation on
the source code could change the meaning of the default value. In that case
a new way to denote the given value is established. For example, consider
this class using a primary constructor:

```dart
static const d = 42;

class Point(int x, [int y = d]) {
  void d() {}
}
```

This corresponds to the following class without a primary constructor:

```dart
static const d = 42;
static const _freshName = d; // Eliminate the name clash.

class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
  Point(this.x, [this.y = _freshName]);
  void d() {}
}
```

The class header can have additional elements, just like class headers
where there is no primary constructor:

```dart
class D<TypeVariable extends Bound> extends A with M implements B, C {
  final int x;
  final int y;
  const D.named(this.x, [this.y = 0]);
}

class const D<TypeVariable extends Bound>.named(int x, [int y = 0])
    extends A with M implements B, C;
```

In the case where the header gets unwieldy it is possible to declare the
primary constructor in the body of the class, which is also equivalent to
the previous examples:

```dart
class D<TypeVariable extends Bound> extends A with M implements B, C {
  primary const D.named(int x, [int y = 0]);
}
```

This approach offers more flexibility in that a primary constructor in the
body of the declaration can have initializers and a body, just like other
constructors. In other words, `primary` on a constructor has one effect
only, which is to introduce instance variables for formal parameters in the
same way as a primary constructor in the header of the declaration. For
example:

```dart
class A {
  A(String _);
}

class E extends A {
  LongTypeExpression x1;
  LongTypeExpression x2;
  LongTypeExpression x3;
  LongTypeExpression x4;
  LongTypeExpression x5;
  LongTypeExpression x6;
  LongTypeExpression x7;
  LongTypeExpression x8;
  external int y;
  int z;
  final List<String> w;

  E({
    required this.x1,
    required this.x2,
    required this.x3,
    required this.x4,
    required this.x5,
    required this.x6,
    required this.x7,
    required this.x8,
    required this.y,
  })  : z = 1,
        w = const <Never>[],
        super('Something') {
    // A normal constructor body.
  }
}

class E extends A {
  external int y;
  int z;
  final List<String> w;

  primary E({
    LongTypeExpression x1,
    LongTypeExpression x2,
    LongTypeExpression x3,
    LongTypeExpression x4,
    LongTypeExpression x5,
    LongTypeExpression x6,
    LongTypeExpression x7,
    LongTypeExpression x8,
    this.y,
  })  : z = 1,
        w = const <Never>[],
        super('Something') {
    // A normal constructor body.
  }
}
```

## Specification

### Syntax

The grammar is modified as follows. Note that the changes include support
for extension type declarations, because they're intended to use primary
constructors as well.

```
<topLevelDefinition> ::=
     <classDeclaration>
   | <extensionTypeDeclaration> // New alternative.
   | ...;

<classDeclaration> ::= // First alternative modified.
     (<classModifiers> | <mixinClassModifiers>)
     'class' <classNamePart> <superclass>? <interfaces>? <classBody>
   | ...;

<classNamePart> ::= // New rule.
     'const'? <constructorName> <typeParameters>? <formalParameterList>
   | <typeWithParameters>;

<classBody> ::= // New rule.
     '{' (<metadata> <classMemberDeclaration>)* '}'
   | ';';

<extensionTypeDeclaration> ::=
     'extension' 'type' 'const'? <typeWithParameters>
     <representationDeclaration>
     <interfaces>?
     <extensionTypeBody>;

<representationDeclaration> ::=
     ('.' <identifierOrNew>)? '(' <metadata> <type> <identifier> ')';

<extensionTypeMemberDeclaration> ::= <classMemberDeclaration>;

<extensionTypeBody> ::=
     '{' (<metadata> <extensionTypeMemberDeclaration>)* '}'
   | ';';

<enumType> ::= // Modified rule.
     'enum' <classNamePart> <mixins>? <interfaces>? '{'
        <enumEntry> (',' <enumEntry>)* (',')?
        (';' (<metadata> <classMemberDeclaration>)*)?
     '}';

<methodSignature> ::=
     'primary'? <constructorSignature> <initializers>
   | 'primary'? <factoryConstructorSignature>
   | ... // Other cases unchanged.
   | 'primary'? <constructorSignature>;

<declaration> ::=
     ... // Other cases unchanged.
   | 'primary'? <redirectingFactoryConstructorSignature>
   | 'primary'? <constantConstructorSignature> (<redirection> | <initializers>)?
   | 'primary'? <constructorSignature> (<redirection> | <initializers>)?;
```

The word `type` is now used in the grammar, but it is not a reserved word
or a built-in identifier. A parser that encounters the tokens `extension`
and then `type` at a location where top-level declaration is expected shall
commit to parsing it as an `<extensionTypeDeclaration>`. *This eliminates
an ambiguity with `extension` (not `extension type`) declarations.*

A class declaration whose class body is `;` is treated as a class declaration
whose class body is `{}`.

*The meaning of a primary constructor is defined in terms of rewriting it to a
body constructor and zero or more instance variable declarations. This implies
that there is a class body when there is a primary constructor. We do not wish
to define primary constructors such that the absence or presence of a primary
constructor can change the length of the superclass chain, and hence `class C;`
has a class body just like `class C(int i);` and just like `class C extends
Object {}`, and all three of them have `Object` as their direct superclass.*

### Static processing

Consider a class declaration or an extension type declaration with a
primary constructor *(note that it cannot be a `<mixinApplicationClass>`,
because that kind of declaration does not support primary constructors,
it's just a syntax error)*. This declaration is desugared to a class or
extension type declaration without a primary constructor. An enum
declaration with a primary constructor is desugared using the same
steps. This determines the dynamic semantics of a primary constructor.

A compile-time error occurs if a class, extension type, or enum declaration
has a primary constructor in the header as well as a constructor with the
modifier `primary` in the body.

The following errors apply to formal parameters of a primary constructor.
Let _p_ be a formal parameter of a primary constructor in a class `C`:

A compile-time error occurs if _p_ contains a term of the form `this.v`, or
`super.v` where `v` is an identifier, and _p_ has the modifier
`covariant`. *For example, `required covariant int this.v` is an error.*

A compile-time error occurs if _p_ has both of the modifiers `covariant`
and `final`. *A final instance variable cannot be covariant, because being
covariant is a property of the setter.*

Conversely, it is not an error for the modifier `covariant` to occur on
other formal parameters of a primary constructor (this extends the
existing allowlist of places where `covariant` can occur).

The desugaring consists of the following steps, where _D_ is the class,
extension type, or enum declaration in the program that includes a primary
constructor in the header, and _D2_ is the result of desugaring. The
desugaring step will delete elements that amount to the primary
constructor; it will add a new constructor _k_; it will add zero or more
instance variable declarations; and it will add zero or more top-level
constants *(holding parameter default values)*.

Where no processing is mentioned below, _D2_ is identical to _D_. Changes
occur as follows:

The current scope of the formal parameter list of the primary constructor
in _D_ is the current scope of the class/enum declaration *(in other words,
the default values cannot see declarations in the class body)*. Every
default value in the primary constructor of _D_ is replaced by a fresh
private name `_n`, and a constant variable named `_n` is added to the
top-level of the current library, with an initializing expression which is
said default value. *(This means that we can move the parameter
declarations including the default value without changing its meaning.)*

For each of these constant variable declarations, the declared type is the
formal parameter type of the corresponding formal parameter, except: In the
case where the corresponding formal parameter has a type `T` where one or
more type variables declared by _D_ occur, the declared type of the
constant variable is the least closure of `T` with respect to the type
parameters of the class.

*For example, if the default value is `const []` and the parameter type is
`List<X>`, the top-level constant will be `const List<Never> _n = [];` for
some fresh name `_n`.*

Next, _k_ has the modifier `const` iff the keyword `const` occurs just
before the name of _D_, or _D_ is an `enum` declaration.

If the name `C` in _D_ and the type parameter list, if any, is followed by
`.id` where `id` is an identifier then _k_ has the name `C.id`. If it is
followed by `.new` then _k_ has the name `C`. If it is not followed by `.`
then _k_ has the name `C`.

If it exists, _D2_ omits the part derived from `'.' <identifierOrNew>` that
follows the name and type parameter list, if any, in _D_.

_D2_ omits the formal parameter list _L_ that follows the name, type
parameter list, if any, and `.id`, if any.

The formal parameter list _L2_ of _k_ is identical to _L_, except that each
formal parameter is processed as follows.

In particular, the formal parameters in _L_ and _L2_ occur in the same
order, and mandatory positional parameters remain mandatory, and named
parameters preserve the name and the modifier `required`, if any.  An
optional positional or named parameter remains optional; if it has a
default value `d` in _L_ then it has the transformed default value `_n` in
_L2_, where `_n` is the name of the constant variable created for that
default value. Finally, if `p` is an optional named parameter in _L_ with
no default value whose type is potentially non-nullable then `required` is
added to `p` in _L2_.

- An initializing formal parameter *(e.g., `this.x`)* is copied from _L_ to
  _L2_, using said transformed default value, if any, and otherwise
  unchanged.
- A super parameter is copied from _L_ to _L2_ using said transformed
  default value, if any, and is otherwise unchanged.
- A formal parameter (named or positional) of the form `T p` or `final T p`
  where `T` is a type and `p` is an identifier is replaced in _L2_ by
  `this.p`. A parameter of the same form but with a default value uses said
  transformed default value.
  Next, an instance variable declaration of the form `T p;` or `final T p;`
  is added to _D2_. The instance variable has the modifier `final` if the
  parameter in _L_ is `final`, or _D_ is an `extension type` declaration,
  or _D_ is an `enum` declaration, or the modifier `const` occurs just
  before the class name in _D_.
  In all cases, if `p` has the modifier `covariant` then this modifier is
  removed from the parameter in _L2_, and it is added to the instance
  variable declaration named `p`.

Finally, _k_ is added to _D2_, and _D_ is replaced by _D2_.

Assume that _D_ is a class, extension type, or enum declaration in the
program that includes a constructor declaration _k_ in the body which has
the modifier `primary`. In this case, no transformations are applied to the
default values of formal parameters of _k_, but otherwise the formal
parameters of _k_ are processed in the same way as they are with a primary
constructor in the declaration header.

### Discussion

It could be argued that primary constructors should support arbitrary
superinvocations using the specified superclass:

```dart
class B extends A { // OK.
  B(int a): super(a);
}

class B(int a) extends A(a); // Could be supported, but isn't!
```

There are several reasons why this is not supported. First, primary constructors
should be small and easy to read. Next, it is not obvious how the
superconstructor arguments would fit into a mixin application (e.g., when the
superclass is `A with M1, M2`), or how readable it would be if the
superconstructor is named (`class B(int a) extends A.name(a);`). For instance,
would it be obvious to all readers that the superclass is `A` and not `A.name`,
and that all other constructors than the primary constructor will ignore the
implied superinitialization `super.name(a)` and do their own thing (which might
be implicit).

In short, if you need to write a complex superinitialization like
`super.name(e1, otherName: e2)` then you need to use a body constructor.

There was a [proposal from Bob][] that the primary constructor should be
expressed at the end of the class header, in order to avoid readability
issues in the case where the superinterfaces contain a lot of text. It
would then use the keyword `new` or `const`, optionally followed by `'.'
<identifier>`, just before the `(` of the primary constructor parameter
list:

[proposal from Bob]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2364#issuecomment-1203071697

```dart
class D<TypeVariable extends Bound> extends A with M implements B, C
    const.named(
  LongTypeExpression x1,
  LongTypeExpression x2,
  LongTypeExpression x3,
  LongTypeExpression x4,
  LongTypeExpression x5,
) {
  ... // Lots of stuff.
}
```

That proposal may certainly be helpful in the case where the primary
constructor receives a large number of arguments with long types, etc.
However, the proposal has not been included in this proposal. One reason is
that it could be better to use a body constructor whenever there is so much
text. Also, it could be helpful to be able to search for the named
constructor using `D.named`, and that would fail if we use the approach
where it occurs as `new.named` or `const.named` because that particular
constructor has been expressed as a primary constructor.

A variant of this idea, from Leaf, is that we could allow one constructor
in a class with no primary constructor in the header to be marked as a
"primary constructor in the body". This proposal has now been made part
of the proposal.

A proposal which was mentioned during the discussions about primary
constructors was that the keyword `final` could be used in order to specify
that all instance variables introduced by the primary constructor are
`final` (but the constructor wouldn't be constant, and hence there's more
freedom in the declaration of the rest of the class). However, that
proposal is not included here, because it may be a source of confusion that
`final` may also occur as a modifier on the class itself, and also because
the resulting class header does not contain syntax which is already similar
to a body constructor declaration.

For example, `class final Point(int x, int y);` cannot use the similarity
to a body constructor declaration to justify the keyword `final`.

```dart
class Point {
  final int x;
  final int y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}

class final Point(int x, int y); // Not supported!
```

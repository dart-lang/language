## Introduction

TODO

## Proposal

This proposal specifies anonymous methods. This is a new kind of expression
that allows general expressions or blocks of code to be executed in a way
that is similar to a method invocation, but inlining the code into the
expression itself.

### Syntax

The grammar is modified as follows:

```ebnf

```

### Static analysis




### Dynamic semantics




### Migration





### Revisions

- 1.0, 2025-Oct-31: Initial version of this feature specification.

# Dart language evolution

[![Dart CI](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/actions/workflows/dart.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/actions/workflows/dart.yml)

This repository is the home for the design and evolution of the [Dart][website]
programming language. While the natural of language evolution is somewhat
unstructured, we follow [a defined process][process] to design and ship language
changes.

The [language funnel][] shows the features that are being actively worked on.

## Contributing

We discuss language problems and potential features using the [issue tracker][]
on this repo. We welcome your participation! Please keep in mind:

*   If you want to show support for a proposed change, a :+1: reaction is more
    helpful than a comment because it's easier for us to aggregate demand that
    way. Comments that provide additional context are still useful, though.

*   Before filing a new issue describing a problem or language change, see if
    there is already an existing issue that's close to yours. Duplicate or
    near-duplicates tend to divide attention and make both of them less visible.

*   When discussing a language change, motivating examples from real world code
    are very helpful for the team and others following along to see how the
    change would be helpful in a concrete context.

*   While other languages often have excellent beloved features, those features
    don't always translate well to Dart (and vice versa). When proposing that
    we borrow some feature from another language, try to articulate why you
    think that feature would be right for Dart in particular. We want Dart to be
    the best Dart, not the second-best Rust/Haskell/TypeScript/etc.

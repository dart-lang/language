# Dart language evolution

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dart-lang/language.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dart-lang/language)

This repository is a place for the [Dart][website] language team to work on
language changes and features, and to solicit and accept feedback and requests.

Issues and feature requests relevant to the language and the specification may
be filed [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues).

# Dart language team

# Organization

We follow [this process](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/doc/life_of_a_language_feature.md)
for planning and rolling out language changes.

Features currently being worked on are listed in the
[language funnel](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/projects/1).

## Contributing

Anyone can participate in the discussion about language changes
by participating on the dart language mailing list,
by replying to issues in this repository,
and by uploading documents, tests or other resources.

When commenting on issues in this repository, keep in mind:

-   :+1: reactions are more useful than comments to show support.
-   Motivating examples help us understand why you want new features more than
    pointers to other languages which have them. We love hearing feedback about
    your experiences with other languages, but we also want to know why they are
    right for Dart in particular.

## Summary

This document specifies a language feature that we call "inline classes".

The feature introduces _inline classes_, which is a new kind of class
declared by a new `inline class` declaration. An inline class provides a
replacement of the members available on instances of an existing type:
when the static type of the instance is an inline type _V_, the available
instance members are exactly the ones provided by _V_ (noting that
there may also be some accessible and applicable extension members).

In contrast, when the static type of an instance is not an inline type,
it is (by soundness) always the run-time type of the instance or a
supertype thereof. This means that the available instance members are
the members of the run-time type of the instance, or a subset thereof
(and there may also be some extension members).

Hence, using a supertype as the static type allows us to see only a
subset of the members. Using an inline type allows us to _replace_ the
set of members, with subsetting as a special case.

This functionality is entirely static. Invocation of an inline member is
resolved at compile-time, based on the static type of the receiver.

An inline class may be considered to be a zero-cost abstraction in the
sense that it works similarly to a wrapper object that holds the
wrapped object in a final instance variable. The inline class thus
provides an interface which is chosen independently of the interface
of the wrapped object, and it provides implementations of the members
of the interface of the inline class, and those implementations can use
the members of the wrapped object as needed.

However, even though an inline class behaves like a wrapping, the wrapper
object will never exist at run time, and a reference whose type is the
inline class will actually refer directly to the underlying wrapped
object.

Consider a member access (e.g., a method call like `e.m(2)`)
where the static type of the receiver (`e`) is an inline class `V`.
In general, the member (`m`) will be a member of `V`, not a member of
the static type of the wrapped object, and the invocation of that
member will be resolved statically (just like extension methods).
This means that the wrapper object is not actually needed.

Given that there is no wrapper object, we will refer to the "wrapped"
object as the _representation object_ of the inline class, or just the
_representation_.

Inside the inline class declaration, the keyword `this` is a reference
to the representation whose static type is the enclosing inline
class. A member access to a member of the enclosing inline class may
rely on `this` being induced implicitly (for example, `foo()` means
`this.foo()` if the inline class contains a method declaration named
`foo`, or it has a superinterface that has a `foo`, and no `foo`
exists in the enclosing top-level scope). In other words, scopes and
`this` have exactly the same interaction as in regular classes.

A reference to the representation typed by its run-time type or a
supertype thereof (that is, typed by a "normal" type for the
representation) is available as a declared name: The inline class must
have exactly one instance variable whose type is the representation
type, and it must be `final`.

All in all, an inline class allows us to replace the interface of a given
representation object and specify how to implement the new interface
in terms of the interface of the representation object.

This is something that we could obviously do with a regular class used
as a wrapper, but when it is done with an inline class there is no
wrapper object, and hence there is no run-time performance cost. In
particular, in the case where we have an inline type `V` with
representation type `R`, we can refer to an object `theRList` of type
`List<R>` using the type `List<V>` (e.g., we could use the cast
`theRList as List<V>`), and this corresponds to "wrapping every
element in the list", but it only takes time _O(1)_ and no space, no
matter how many elements the list contains.


## Motivation

A _inline class_ is a zero-cost abstraction mechanism that allows
developers to replace the set of available operations on a given object
(that is, the instance members of its type) by a different set of
operations (the members declared by the given inline type).

It is zero-cost in the sense that the value denoted by an expression
whose type is an inline type is an object of a different type (known as
the _representation type_ of the inline type), and there is no wrapper
object, in spite of the fact that the inline class behaves similarly to
a wrapping.

The point is that the inline type allows for a convenient and safe treatment
of a given object `o` (and objects reachable from `o`) for a specialized
purpose. It is in particular aimed at the situation where that purpose
requires a certain discipline in the use of `o`'s instance methods: We may
call certain methods, but only in specific ways, and other methods should
not be called at all. This kind of added discipline can be enforced by
accessing `o` typed as an inline type, rather than typed as its run-time
type `R` or some supertype of `R` (which is what we normally do). For
example:

```dart
inline class IdNumber {
  final int i;

  IdNumber(this.i);

  // Declare a few members.

  // Assume that it makes sense to compare ID numbers
  // because they are allocated with increasing values,
  // so "smaller" means "older".
  operator <(IdNumber other) => i < other.i;

  // Assume that we can verify an ID number relative to
  // `Some parameters`, filtering out some fake ID numbers.
  bool verify(Some parameters) => ...;

  ... // Some other members, whatever is needed.

  // We do not declare, e.g., an operator +, because addition
  // does not make sense for ID numbers.
}

void main() {
  int myUnsafeId = 42424242;
  myUnsafeId = myUnsafeId + 10; // No complaints.

  var safeId = IdNumber(42424242);

  safeId.verify(); // OK, could be true.
  safeId + 10; // Compile-time error, no operator `+`.
  10 + safeId; // Compile-time error, wrong argument type.
  myUnsafeId = safeId; // Compile-time error, wrong type.
  myUnsafeId = safeId as int; // OK, we can force it.
  myUnsafeId = safeId.i; // OK, and safer than a cast.
}
```

In short, we want an `int` representation, but we want to make sure
that we don't accidentally add ID numbers or multiply them, and we
don't want to silently pass an ID number (e.g., as an actual arguments
or in an assignment) where an `int` is expected. The inline class
`IdNumber` will do all these things.

We can actually cast away the inline type and hence get access to the
interface of the representation, but we assume that the developer
wishes to maintain this extra discipline, and won't cast away the
inline type unless there is a good reason to do so. Similarly, we can
access the representation using the representation name as a getter.
There is no reason to consider the latter to be a violation of any
kind of encapsulation or protection barrier, it's just like any other
getter invocation. If desired, the author of the inline class can
choose to use a private representation name, to obtain a small amount
of extra encapsulation.

The extra discipline is enforced because the inline member
implementations will only treat the representation object in ways that
are written with the purpose of conforming to this particular
discipline (and thereby defines what this discipline is). For example,
if the discipline includes the rule that you should never call a
method `foo` on the representation, then the author of the inline class
will simply need to make sure that none of the inline member
declarations ever calls `foo`.

Another example would be that we're using interop with JavaScript, and
we wish to work on a given `JSObject` representing a button, using a
`Button` interface which is meaningful for buttons. In this case the
implementation of the members of `Button` will call some low-level
functions like `js_util.getProperty`, but a client who uses the inline
class will have a full implementation of the `Button` interface, and
will hence never need to call `js_util.getProperty`.

(We _can_ just call `js_util.getProperty` anyway, because it accepts
two arguments of type `Object`. But we assume that the developer will
be happy about sticking to the rule that the low-level functions
aren't invoked in application code, and they can do that by using inline
classes like `Button`. It is then easy to `grep` your application code
and verify that it never calls `js_util.getProperty`.)

Another potential application would be to generate inline class
declarations handling the navigation of dynamic object trees that are
known to satisfy some sort of schema outside the Dart type system. For
instance, they could be JSON values, modeled using `num`, `bool`,
`String`, `List<dynamic>`, and `Map<String, dynamic>`, and those JSON
values might again be structured according to some schema.

Without inline types, the JSON value would most likely be handled with
static type `dynamic`, and all operations on it would be unsafe. If the
JSON value is assumed to satisfy a specific schema, then it would be
possible to reason about this dynamic code and navigate the tree correctly
according to the schema. However, the code where this kind of careful
reasoning is required may be fragmented into many different locations, and
there is no help detecting that some of those locations are treating the
tree incorrectly according to the schema.

If inline classes are available then we can declare a set of inline types
with operations that are tailored to work correctly with the given
schema and its subschemas. This is less error-prone and more
maintainable than the approach where the tree is handled with static
type `dynamic` everywhere.

Here's an example that shows the core of that scenario. The schema that
we're assuming allows for nested `List<dynamic>` with numbers at the
leaves, and nothing else.

```dart
inline class TinyJson {
  final Object it;
  TinyJson(this.it);
  Iterable<num> get leaves sync* {
    if (it is num) {
      yield it;
    } else if (it is List<dynamic>) {
      for (var element in it) {
        yield* TinyJson(element).leaves;
      }
    } else {
      throw "Unexpected object encountered in TinyJson value";
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  var tiny = TinyJson(<dynamic>[<dynamic>[1, 2], 3, <dynamic>[]]);
  print(tiny.leaves);
  tiny.add("Hello!"); // Error.
}
```

Note that `it` is subject to promotion in the above example. This is safe
because there is no way to override this would-be final instance variable.

An instance creation of an inline type, `Inline<T>(o)`, will evaluate
to a reference to the value of the final instance variable of the
inline class, with the static type `Inline<T>` (and there is no object
at run time that represents the inline class itself).

Returning to the example, the name `TinyJson` can be used as a type,
and a reference with that type can refer to an instance of the
underlying representation type `Object`. In the example, the inferred
type of `tiny` is `TinyJson`.

We can now impose an enhanced discipline on the use of `tiny`, because
the inline type allows for invocations of the members of the inline class,
which enables a specific treatment of the underlying instance of
`Object`, consistent with the assumed schema.

The getter `leaves` is an example of a disciplined use of the given object
structure. The run-time type may be a `List<dynamic>`, but the schema which
is assumed allows only for certain elements in this list (that is, nested
lists or numbers), and in particular it should never be a `String`. The use
of the `add` method on `tiny` would have been allowed if we had used the
type `List<dynamic>` (or `dynamic`) for `tiny`, and that could break the
schema.

When the type of the receiver is the inline type `TinyJson`, it is a
compile-time error to invoke any members that are not in the interface of
the inline type (in this case that means: the members declared in the
body of `TinyJson`). So it is an error to call `add` on `tiny`, and that
protects us from this kind of schema violations.

In general, the use of an inline class allows us to keep some unsafe
operations in a specific location (namely inside the inline class, or
inside one of a set of collaborating inline classes). We can then
reason carefully about each operation once and for all. Clients use
the inline class to access objects conforming to the given schema, and
that gives them access to a set of known-safe operations, making all
other operations in the interface of the representation type a
compile-time error.

One possible perspective is that an inline type corresponds to an abstract
data type: There is an underlying representation, but we wish to restrict
the access to that representation to a set of operations that are
independent of the operations available on the representation. In other
words, the inline type ensures that we only work with the representation in
specific ways, even though the representation itself has an interface that
allows us to do many other (wrong) things.

It would be straightforward to enforce an added discipline like this by
writing a wrapper class with the allowed operations as members, and
working on a wrapper object rather than accessing the representation
object and its methods directly:

```dart
// Emulate the inline class using a class.

class TinyJson {
  // The representation is assumed to be a nested list of numbers.
  final Object it;

  TinyJson(this.it);

  Iterable<num> get leaves sync* {
    var localIt = it; // To get promotion.
    if (localIt is num) {
      yield localIt;
    } else if (localIt is List<dynamic>) {
      for (var element in localIt) {
        yield* TinyJson(element).leaves;
      }
    } else {
      throw "Unexpected object encountered in TinyJson value";
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  var tiny = TinyJson(<dynamic>[<dynamic>[1, 2], 3, <dynamic>[]]);
  print(tiny.leaves);
  tiny.add("Hello!"); // Error.
}
```

This is similar to the inline type in that it enforces the use of
specific operations only (here we have just one: `leaves`), and it
makes it an error to use instance methods of the representation (e.g.,
`add`).

Creation of wrapper objects consumes space and time. In the case where
we wish to work on an entire data structure, we'd need to wrap each
object as we navigate the data structure. For instance, we need to
create a wrapper `TinyJson(element)` in order to invoke `leaves`
recursively.

In contrast, the inline class is zero-cost, in the sense that it does
_not_ use a wrapper object, it enforces the desired discipline
statically. In the inline class, the invocation of `TinyJson(element)`
in the body of `leaves` can be eliminated entirely by inlining.

Inline classes are static in nature, like extension members: an inline
class declaration may declare some type parameters. The type
parameters will be bound to types which are determined by the static
type of the receiver. Similarly, members of an inline type are resolved
statically, i.e., if `tiny.leaves` is an invocation of an inline getter
`leaves`, then the declaration named `leaves` whose body is executed
is determined at compile-time. There is no support for late binding of
an inline member, and hence there is no notion of overriding. In return
for this lack of expressive power, we get improved performance.


## Syntax

A rule for `<inlineClassDeclaration>` is added to the grammar, along
with some rules for elements used in inline class declarations:

```ebnf
<inlineClassDeclaration> ::=
  'final'? 'inline' 'class' <typeIdentifier> <typeParameters>? <interfaces>?
  '{'
    (<metadata> <inlineMemberDeclaration>)*
  '}'

<inlineMemberDeclaration> ::= <classMemberDefinition>
```

*The token `inline` is not made a built-in identifier: the reserved
word `class` that occurs right after `inline` serves to disambiguate
the inline class declaration with a fixed lookahead.*

A few errors can be detected immediately from the syntax:

A compile-time error occurs if the inline class does not declare any
instance variables, and if it declares two or more instance
variables. Let `id` be the name of unique instance variable that it
declares. The declaration of `id` must have the modifier `final`, and it
can not have the modifier `late`; otherwise a compile-time error
occurs.

The _name of the representation_ in an inline class declaration is the
name `id` of the unique final instance variable that it declares, and
the _type of the representation_ is the declared type of `id`.

A compile-time error occurs if an inline class declaration declares an
abstract member.

*There are no special rules for static members in inline classes. They
can be declared and called or torn off as usual, e.g.,
`Inline.myStaticMethod(42)`.*


## Inline Method Invocations

This document needs to refer to inline method invocations including
each part that determines the static analysis and semantics of this
invocation, so we will use a standardized phrase and talk about:
An invocation of the inline member `m` on the receiver `e`
according to the inline type `V` and with the actual type arguments
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub></code>.

In the case where `m` is a method, the invocation could be an inline
member property extraction (*a tear-off*) or a method invocation,
and in the latter case there will also be an `<argumentPart>`,
optionally passing some actual type arguments, and (non-optionally)
passing an actual argument list.

The case where `m` is a setter is syntactically different, but the
treatment is the same as with a method accepting a single argument
(*so we will not specify that case explicitly*).

*We need to mention all these elements together, because each of them
plays a role in the static analysis and the dynamic semantics of the
invocation.  There is no syntactic representation in the language for
this concept, because the same inline method invocation can have many
different syntactic forms, and both `V` and <code>T<sub>1</sub>, ...,
T<sub>s</sub></code> are implicit in the actual syntax.*


### Static Analysis of an Inline Member Invocation

We need to introduce a concept that is similar to existing concepts
for regular classes.

We say that an inline class declaration _DV_ _has_ a member named `n`
in the case where _DV_ declares a member named `n`, and in the case
where _DV_ has no such declaration, but _DV_ has a direct
superinterface `V` that has a member named `n`. In both cases,
_the member declaration named `n` that DV has_ is said declaration.

*This definition is unambiguous for an inline class that has no
compile-time errors, because name clashes must be resolved by `V`.*

Consider an invocation of the inline member `m` on the receiver `e`
according to the inline type `V` and with the actual type arguments
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub></code>. If the invocation
includes an actual argument part (possibly including some actual type
arguments) then call it `args`. Finally, assume that `V` declares the
type variables <code>X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>s</sub></code>.

*Note that it is known that
<code>V&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
has no compile-time errors. In particular, the number of actual type
arguments is correct, and it is a regular-bounded type,
and the static type of `e` is a subtype of
<code>V&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>,
or a subtype of the corresponding instantiated representation type
(defined below). This is required when we decide that a given
expression is an inline member invocation.*

If the name of `m` is a name in the interface of `Object` (*that is,
`toString`, `==`, etc.*), the static analysis of the invocation is
treated as an ordinary instance member invocation on a receiver of
type `Object` and with the same `args`, if any.

Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs if `V` does not have a member
named `m`.

Otherwise, let _Dm_ be the declaration of `m` that `V` has.

If _Dm_ is a getter declaration with return type `R` then the static
type of the invocation is
<code>[T<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>1</sub> .. T<sub>s</sub>/X<sub>s</sub>]R</code>.

If _Dm_is a method with function type `F`, and `args` is omitted, the
invocation has static type
<code>[T<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>1</sub> .. T<sub>s</sub>/X<sub>s</sub>]F</code>.
*This is an inline method tear-off.*

If _Dm_ is a method with function type `F`, and `args` exists, the
static analysis of the inline member invocation is the same as that of
an invocation with argument part `args` of a function with type
<code>[T<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>1</sub> .. T<sub>s</sub>/X<sub>s</sub>]F</code>.
*This determines the compile-time errors, if any, and it determines
the type of the invocation as a whole.*


### Dynamic Semantics of an Inline Member Invocation

Consider an invocation of the inline member `m` on the receiver `e`
according to the inline type `V` and with actual type arguments
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub></code>. If the invocation
includes an actual argument part (possibly including some actual type
arguments) then call it `args`. Assume that `V` declares the
type variables <code>X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>s</sub></code>.

Let _Dm_ be the declaration named `m` thath `V` has.

Evaluation of this invocation proceeds by evaluating `e` to an object
`o`.

Then, if `args` is omitted and _Dm_ is a getter, execute the body of
said getter in an environment where `this` and the name of the
representation are bound to `o`, and the type variables of `V` are
bound to the actual values of
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub></code>.
If the body completes returning an object `o2` then the invocation
evaluates to `o2`. If the body throws an object and a stack trace
then the invocation completes throwing the same object and stack
trace.

Otherwise, if `args` is omitted and _Dm_ is a method, the invocation
evaluates to a closurization of _Dm_ where
`this` and the name of the representation are bound to `o`, and the
type variables of `V` are bound to the actual values of
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub></code>.
The operator `==` of the closurization returns true if and only if the
operand is the same object.

*Loosely said, these function objects simply use the equality
inherited from `Object`, there are no special exceptions. Note that
we can tear off the same method from the same inline class with the
same representation object twice, and still get different behavior,
because the inline type had different actual type arguments. Hence,
we can not consider two inline method tear-offs equal just because
they have the same receiver.*

Otherwise, the following is known: `args` is included, and _Dm_ is a
method. The invocation proceeds to evaluate `args` to an actual
argument list `args1`. Then it executes the body of _Dm_ in an
environment where `this` and the name of the representation are bound
to `o`, the type variables of `V` are bound to the actual values of
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub></code>,
and the formal parameters of `m` are bound to `args1` in the same way
that they would be bound for a normal function call.
If the body completes returning an object `o2` then the invocation
evaluates to `o2`. If the body throws an object and a stack trace
then the invocation completes throwing the same object and stack
trace.


## Static Analysis of Inline Classes

The unique instance variable declared by an inline class must have a
type annotation.

*In particular, the type of this variable cannot be obtained by
inference. An important part of the rationale for this rule is that
the representation type of an inline class plays a role in the
semantics of the class which is broader and more significant than that
of an instance variable in a normal class or mixin, and hence it
should be documented explicitly.*

Assume that
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub></code>
are types, and `V` resolves to an inline class declaration of the
following form:

```dart
inline class V<X1 extends B1, .. Xs extends Bs> ... {
  final T id;
  V(this.id);

  ... // Other members.
}
```

It is then allowed to use
<code>V&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
as a type.

*For example, it can occur as the declared type of a variable or
parameter, as the return type of a function or getter, as a type
argument in a type, as the representation type of an inline class, as
the on-type of an extension, as the type in the `onPart` of a
try/catch statement, in a type test `o is V<...>`, in a type cast
`o as V<...>`, or as the body of a type alias. It is also allowed to
create a new instance where one or more inline types occur as type
arguments (e.g., `List<V>.empty()`).*

A compile-time error occurs if the type
<code>V&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
is not regular-bounded.

*In other words, such types can not be super-bounded. The reason for this
restriction is that it is unsound to execute code in the body of `V` in
the case where the values of the type variables do not satisfy their
declared bounds, and those values will be obtained directly from the static
type of the receiver in each member invocation on `V`.*

A compile-time error occurs if a type parameter of an inline class
occurs in a non-covariant position in the representation type.

When `s` is zero,
<code>V&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
simply stands for `V`, a non-generic inline type.
When `s` is greater than zero, a raw occurrence `V` is treated like a raw
type: Instantiation to bound is used to obtain the omitted type arguments.
*Note that this may yield a super-bounded type, which is then a
compile-time error.*

We say that the static type of said variable, parameter, etc.
_is the inline type_
<code>V&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>,
and that its static type _is an inline type_.

It is a compile-time error if `await e` occurs, and the static type of
`e` is an inline type.

*We may loosen this restriction in the future, especially if we
introduce a way for an inline type to be a subtype of a type of the
form `Future<T>` or `FutureOr<T>`.*

A compile-time error occurs if an inline type declares a member whose
name is declared by `Object` as well.

*For example, an inline class cannot define an operator `==` or a
member named `noSuchMethod` or `toString`. The rationale is that these
inline methods would be highly confusing and error prone. For example,
collections would still call the instance operator `==`, not the inline
class operator, and string interpolation would call the instance
method `toString`, not the inline class method. Also, when we make
this an error for now, we have the option to allow it, perhaps with
some restrictions, in a future version of Dart.*

A compile-time error occurs if an inline type is used as a
superinterface of a class or a mixin, or if an inline type is used to
derive a mixin.

*In other words, an inline type cannot occur as a superinterface in an
`extends`, `with`, `implements`, or `on` clause of a class or mixin.
On the other hand, it can occur in other ways, e.g., as a type
argument of a superinterface of a class.*

If `e` is an expression whose static type `V` is the inline type
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
and `m` is the name of a member that `V` has, a member access
like `e.m(args)` is treated as
an invocation of the inline member `m` on the receiver `e`
according to the inline type `Inline` and with the actual type arguments
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub></code>, with the actual
argument part `args`.

Similarly, `e.m` is treated an invocation of the inline member `m` on
the receiver `e` according to the inline type `Inline` and with the
actual type arguments
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub></code>
and no actual argument part.

*Setter invocations are treated as invocations of methods with a
single argument.*

If `e` is an expression whose static type `V` is the inline type
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
and `V` has no member whose basename is the basename of `m`, a member
access like `e.m(args)` may be an extension member access, following
the normal rules about applicability and accessibility of extensions,
in particular that `V` must match the on-type of the extension.

*In the body of an inline class declaration _DV_ with name `Inline`
and type parameters
<code>X<sub>1</sub>, .. X<sub>s</sub></code>, for an invocation like
`m(args)`, if a declaration named `m` is found in the body of _DV_
then that invocation is treated as
an invocation of the inline member `m` on the receiver `this`
according to the inline type `Inline` and with the actual type arguments
<code>T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>s</sub></code>, with the actual
argument part `args`.
This is just the same treatment of `this` as in the body of a class.*

*For example:*

```dart
extension E1 on int {
  void foo() { print('E1.foo'); }
}

inline class V1 {
  final int it;
  V1(this.it);
  void foo() { print('V1.foo'); }
  void baz() { print('V1.baz'); }
  void qux() { print('V1.qux'); }
}

void qux() { print('qux'); }

inline class V2 {
  final V1 it;
  V2(this.it);
  void foo() { print('V2.foo); }
  void bar() {
    foo(); // Prints 'V2.foo'.
    it.foo(); // Prints 'V1.foo'.
    it.baz(); // Prints 'V1.baz'.
    1.foo(); // Prints 'E1.foo'.
    1.baz(); // Compile-time error.
    qux(); // Prints 'qux'.
  }
}
```

*That is, when the static type of an expression is an inline type `V`
with representation type `R`, each method invocation on that
expression will invoke an instance method declared by `V` or inherited
from a superinterface (or it could be an extension method with on-type
`V`).  Similarly for other member accesses.*

Let _DV_ be an inline class declaration named `Inline` with type
parameters
<code>X<sub>1</sub> extends B<sub>1</sub>, .. X<sub>s</sub> extends B<sub>s</sub></code>.
Assume that _DV_ declares a final instance variable with name `id` and
type `R`.

We say that the _declared representation type_ of `Inline`
is `R`, and the _instantiated representation type_ corresponding to
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>,.. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code> is
<code>[T<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>/X<sub>s</sub>]R</code>.

We will omit 'declared' and 'instantiated' from the phrase when it is
clear from the context whether we are talking about the inline class
itself, or we're talking about a particular instantiation of a generic
inline class. *For non-generic inline classes, the representation type
is the same in either case.*

Let `V` be an inline type of the form
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>, and let
`R` be the corresponding instantiated representation type.  If `R` is
non-nullable then `V` is a proper subtype of `Object`, and `V` is
non-nullable.  Otherwise, `V` is a proper subtype of `Object?`, and
`V` is potentially nullable.

*That is, an expression of an inline type can be assigned to a top
type (like all other expressions), and if the representation type is
non-nullable then it can also be assigned to `Object`. Non-inline
types (except bottom types) cannot be assigned to inline types without
a cast. Similarly, null cannot be assigned to an inline type without a
cast, even in the case where the representation type is nullable (even
better: don't use a cast, call a constructor instead). Another consequence of
the fact that the inline type is potentially non-nullable is that it
is an error to have an instance variable whose type is an inline type,
and then relying on implicit initialization to null.*

In the body of a member of an inline class declaration _DV_ named
`Inline` and declaring the type parameters
<code>X<sub>1</sub>, .. X<sub>s</sub></code>,
the static type of `this` is
<code>Inline&lt;X<sub>1</sub> .. X<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>.
The static type of the representation name is the representation
type.

*For example, in `inline class V { final R id; ...}`, `id` has type
`R`, and `this` has type `V`.*

Let _DV_ be an inline class declaration named `V` with representation
type `R`. Assuming that all types have been fully alias expanded, we
say that _DV_ has a representation dependency on an inline class
declaration _DV2_ if `R` contains an identifier `id` (possibly
qualified) that resolves to _DV2_, or `id` resolves to an inline class
declaration _DV3_ and _DV3_ has a representation dependency on _DV2_.

It is a compile-time error if an inline class declaration has a
representation dependency on itself.

*In other words, cycles are not allowed. This ensures that it is
always possible to find a non-inline type which is the ultimate
representation type of any given inline type.*

The *inline erasure* of an inline type `V` is obtained by recursively
replacing every subterm of `V` which is an inline type by the
corresponding representation type.

*Note that this inline erasure exists, because it is a compile-time
error to have a dependency cycle among inline types.*

Let
<code>X<sub>1</sub> extends B<sub>1</sub>, .. X<sub>s</sub> extends B<sub>s</sub></code>
be a declaration of the type parameters of a generic entity (*it could
be a generic class, inline or not, or mixin, or typedef, or function*).
Let <code>BB<sub>j</sub></code> be the inline erasure of
<code>B<sub>j</sub></code>, for _j_ in _1 .. s_.
It is a compile-time error if
<code>X<sub>1</sub> extends BB<sub>1</sub>, .. X<sub>s</sub> extends BB<sub>s</sub></code>
has any compile-time errors.

*For example, the inline erasure could map
<code>X extends C<Y>, Y extends X</code> to
<code>X extends Y, Y extends X</code>,
which is an error.*

An inline class declaration _DV_ named `Inline` may declare one or
more constructors. A constructor which is declared in an inline class
declaration is also known as an _inline class constructor_.

*The purpose of having an inline class constructor is that it bundles
an approach for building an instance of the representation type of an
inline declaration _DV_ with _DV_ itself, which makes it easy to
recognize that this is a way to obtain a value of that inline type. It
can also be used to verify that an existing object (provided as an
actual argument to the constructor) satisfies the requirements for
having that inline type.*

A compile-time error occurs if an inline class constructor includes a
superinitializer. *That is, a term of the form `super(...)` or
`super.id(...)` as the last element of the initializer list.*

A compile-time error occurs if an inline class constructor declares a
super parameter. *For instance, `Inline(super.x);`.*

*In the body of a generative inline class constructor, the static type
of `this` is the same as it is in any instance member of the inline
class, that is, `Inline<X1 .. Xk>`, where `X1 .. Xk` are the type
parameters declared by `Inline`.*

An instance creation expression of the form
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;(...)</code>
or
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;.name(...)</code>
is used to invoke these constructors, and the type of such an expression is
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>.

*In short, inline class constructors appear to be very similar to
constructors in regular classes, and they correspond to the situation
where the enclosing class has a single, non-late, final instance
variable, which is initialized according to the normal rules for
constructors (in particular, it can occur by means of `this.id`, or in
an initializer list, or by an initializing expression in the
declaration itself, but it is an error if it does not occur at all).*

An inline type `V` used as an expression (*a type literal*) is allowed
and has static type `Type`.

An inline class declaration _DV_ can have the type modifier
`final`. In this case it is a compile-time error for another inline
class declaration _DV2_ to have a superinterface which is a reference
to _DV_.

*As the grammar shows, any occurrence of the keywords `abstract`,
`base`, `interface`, `sealed`, or `mixin` in an inline class
declaration is a syntax error.*


### Composing Inline Classes

This section describes the effect of including a clause derived from
`<interfaces>` in an inline class declaration. We use the phrase
_the implements clause_ to refer to this clause.

*The rationale is that the set of members and member implementations
of a given inline class may need to overlap with that of other inline
classes. The implements clause allows for implementation reuse by
putting some shared members in an inline class `V`, and including `V`
in the implements clause of several inline class declarations
<code>V<sub>1</sub> .. V<sub>k</sub></code>, thus "inheriting" the
members of `V` into all of <code>V<sub>1</sub> .. V<sub>k</sub></code>
without code duplication.*

*The reason why this mechanism uses the keyword `implements` rather
than `extends` to declare a relation that involves "inheritance" is
that it has a similar semantics as that of extension members (in that
they are statically resolved).*

Assume that _DV_ is an inline class declaration named `Inline`, and
`V1` occurs as one of the `<type>`s in the `<interfaces>` of _DV_. In
this case we say that `V1` is a _superinterface_ of _DV_.

If _DV_ does not include an `<interfaces>` clause then _DV_ has no
superinterfaces.

A compile-time error occurs if `V1` is a type name or a parameterized
type which occurs as a superinterface in an inline class declaration
_DV_, but `V1` does not denote an inline type.

A compile-time error occurs if any direct or indirect superinterface
of _DV_ is the type `Inline` or a type of the form `Inline<...>`. *As
usual, subtype cycles are not allowed.*

Assume that _DV_ has two direct or indirect superinterface of the form
<code>W&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>k</sub>&gt;</code>
respectively
<code>W&lt;S<sub>1</sub>, .. S<sub>k</sub>&gt;</code>.
A compile-time error
occurs if
<code>T<sub>j</sub></code>
is not equal to
<code>S<sub>j</sub></code>
for any _j_ in _1 .. k_. The notion of equality used here is the same
as with the corresponding rule about superinterfaces of classes.

Assume that an inline class declaration _DV_ named `Inline` has
representation type `R`, and that the inline type `V1` with
declaration _DV1_ is a superinterface of _DV_ (*note that `V1` may
have some actual type arguments*).  Assume that `S` is the
instantiated representation type corresponding to `V1`. A compile-time
error occurs if `R` is not a subtype of `S`.

*This ensures that it is sound to bind the value of `id` in _DV_ to `id1`
in `V1` when invoking members of `V1`, where `id` is the representation
name of _DV_ and `id1` is the representation name of _DV1_.*

Assume that _DV_ declares an inline class named `Inline` with type
parameters
<code>X<sub>1</sub> .. X<sub>s</sub></code>,
and `V1` is a superinterface of _DV_. Then
<code>Inline&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub>&gt;</code>
is a subtype of
<code>[T<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>1</sub> .. T<sub>s</sub>/X<sub>s</sub>]V1</code>
for all <code>T<sub>1</sub>, .. T<sub>s</sub></code>.

*In short, if `V1` is a superinterface of `V` then `V1` is also a
supertype of `V`.*

A compile-time error occurs if an inline class declaration _DV_ has
two superinterfaces `V1` and `V2`, where both `V1` and `V2` have a
member named _m_, and the two declarations of _m_ are distinct
declarations, and _DV_ does not declare a member named _m_.

*In other words, if two different declarations of _m_ are inherited
from two superinterfaces then the subinterface must resolve the
conflict. The so-called diamond inheritance pattern can create the
case where two superinterfaces have an _m_, but they are both declared by
the same declaration (so `V` is a subinterface of `V1` and `V2`, and both
`V1` and `V2` are subinterfaces of `V3`, and only `V3` declares _m_,
in which case there is no conflict in `V`).*

*Assume that _DV_ is an inline class declaration named `Inline`, and
the inline type `V1`, declared by _DV1_, is a superinterface of
_DV_. Let `m` be the name of a member of `V1`. If _DV_ also declares a
member named `m` then the latter may be considered similar to a
declaration that "overrides" the former.  However, it should be noted
that inline method invocation is resolved statically, and hence there
is no override relationship among the two in the traditional
object-oriented sense (that is, it will never occur that the
statically known declaration is the member of `V1`, and the member
invoked at run time is the one in _DV_). A receiver with static
type `V1` will invoke the declaration in _DV1_, and a receiver with
static type `Inline` (or `Inline<...>`) will invoke the one in _DV_.*

Hence, we use a different word to describe the relationship between a
member named _m_ of a superinterface, and a member named _m_ which is
declared by the subinterface: We say that the latter _redeclares_ the
former.

*In particular, if two different declarations of _m_ is inherited
from two superinterface then the subinterface can resolve the conflict
by redeclaring _m_.*

*Note that there is no notion of having a 'correct override relation'
here. With inline classes, any member signature can redeclare any
other member signature with the same name, including the case where a
method is redeclared by a getter, or vice versa. The reason for this
is that no call site will resolve to one of several declarations at
run time. Each invocation will statically resolve to one particular
declaration, and this makes it possible to ensure that the invocation
is type correct.*

Assume that _DV_ is an inline class declaration, and that the inline
types `V1` and `V2` are superinterfaces of _DV_. Let `M1` be the
members of `V1`, and `M2` the members of `V2`. A compile-time error
occurs if there is a member name `m` such that `V1` as well as `V2`
has a member named `m`, and they are distinct declarations, and _DV_
does not declare a member named `m`.  *In other words, a name clash
among distinct "inherited" members is an error, but it can be
eliminated by redeclaring the clashing name.*

The effect of having an inline class declaration _DV_ with
superinterfaces `V1, .. Vk` is that the members declared by _DV_ as
well as all members of `V1, .. Vk` that are not redeclared by a
declaration in _DV_ can be invoked on a receiver of the type
introduced by _DV_.


## Dynamic Semantics of Inline Classes

For any given syntactic construct which has been characterized as an
inline member invocation during the static analysis, the dynamic
semantics of the construct is the dynamic semantics of said
inline member invocation.

Consider an inline class declaration _DV_ named `Inline` with
representation name `id` and representation type `R`.  Invocation of a
non-redirecting generative inline class constructor proceeds as follows: A
fresh, non-late, final variable `v` is created. An initializing formal
`this.id` has the side-effect that it initializes `v` to the actual
argument passed to this formal. An initializer list element of the
form `id = e` or `this.id = e` is evaluated by evaluating `e` to an
object `o` and binding `v` to `o`.  During the execution of the
constructor body, `this` and `id` are bound to the value of `v`.  The
value of the instance creation expression that gave rise to this
constructor execution is the value of `this`.

At run time, for a given instance `o` typed as an inline type `V`, there
is _no_ reification of `V` associated with `o`.

*This means that, at run time, an object never "knows" that it is being
viewed as having an inline type. By soundness, the run-time type of `o`
will be a subtype of the representation type of `V`.*

The run-time representation of a type argument which is an inline type
`V` is the corresponding instantiated representation type.

*This means that an inline type and the underlying representation type
are considered as being the same type at run time. So we can freely
use a cast to introduce or discard the inline type, as the static type
of an instance, or as a type argument in the static type of a data
structure or function involving the inline type.*

A type test, `o is U` or `o is! U`, and a type cast, `o as U`, where
`U` is or contains an inline type, is performed at run time as a type
test and type cast on the run-time representation of the inline type
as described above.

An inline type `V` used as an expression (*a type literal*) evaluates
to the value of the corresponding instantiated representation type
used as an expression.


### Summary of Typing Relationships

*Here is an overview of the subtype relationships of an inline type
`V0` with instantiated representation type `R` and superinterfaces
`V1 .. Vk`, as well as other typing relationships involving `V0`:*

- *`V0` is a proper subtype of `Object?`.*
- *`V0` is a supertype of `Never`.*
- *If `R` is a non-nullable type then `V0` is a proper subtype of
  `Object`, and a non-nullable type.*
- *`V0` is a proper subtype of each of `V1 .. Vk`.*
- *At run time, the type `V0` is identical to the type `R`. In
  particular, `o is V0` and `o as V0` have the same dynamic
  semantics as `o is R` respectively `o as R`, and
  `t1 == t2` evaluates to true if `t1` is a `Type` that reifies
  `V0` and `t2` reifies `R`, and the equality also holds if
  `t1` and `t2` reify types where `V0` and `R` occur as subterms
  (e.g., `List<V0>` is equal to `List<R>`).*


## Discussion

This section mentions a few topics that have given rise to
discussions.


### Support "private inheritance"?

In the current proposal there is a subtype relationship between every
inline class and each of its superinterfaces. So if we have
`inline class V implements V1, V2 ...` then `V <: V1` and `V <: V2`.

In some cases it might be preferable to omit the subtype relationship,
even though there is a code reuse element (because `V1` is a
superinterface of `V`, we just don't need or want `V <: V1`).

A possible workaround would be to write forwarding methods manually:

```dart
inline class V1 {
  final R it;
  V1(this.it);
  void foo() {...}
}

// `V` can reuse code from `V1` by using `implements`. Note that
// `S <: R`, because otherwise it is a compile-time error.
inline class V implements V1 {
  final S it;
  V(this.it);
}

// Alternatively, we can write forwarders, in order to avoid
// having the subtype relationship `V <: V1`.
inline class V {
  final S it;
  V(this.it);
  void foo() => V1(it).foo();
}
```

 - [Feature specification](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/future-releases/contravariant-superinterface-2018/feature-specification.md)


## Implementation and Release plan

This feature is concerned with the introduction of one extra compile-time
error, and the breakage has been estimated to be very low.


### Phase 0 (Implementation)

All tools add the implementation of the associated compile-time check, and
start emitting the new error during static analysis.


### Phase 1 (Release)

The update is released as part of the next stable Dart release.


## Timeline

Completion goals for the phases:

- Phase 0: Q1 2019
- Phase 1: Q1 2019

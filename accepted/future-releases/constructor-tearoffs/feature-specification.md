# Dart Constructor Tear-offs

Author: lrn@google.com<br>Version: 2.14

Dart allows you to tear off (aka. closurize) methods instead of just calling them. It does not allow you to tear off *constructors*, even though they are just as callable as methods (and for factory methods, the distinction is mainly philosophical).

It's an annoying shortcoming. We want to allow constructors to be torn off, and users have requested it repeatedly ([#216](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/216), [#1429](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1429)).

This is a proposal for constructor tear-offs which introduces new syntax for the unnamed constructor, for constructor tear-offs, and for explicit instantiation of generic functions tear-offs in general.

## Goal

The goal is that you can always tear off a constructor, then invoke the torn off function and get the same result as invoking the constructor directly. For a named constructor it means that

```dart
var v1 = C.name(args);
var v2 = (C.name)(args);

// and

var v3 = C<typeArgs>.name(args);
var v4 = (C<typeArgs>.name)(args);
var v5 = (C.name)<typeArgs>(args);
```

should always give equivalent values for `v1` and `v2`, and for `v3`, `v4` and `v5`.

We also want a consistent and useful *identity* and *equality* of the torn off functions, with the tear-off expression being a constant expression where possible. It should match what we already do for static function tear-off where that makes sense.

## Proposal

This proposal combines a number of separate-but-related language features, which are described in more detail below. The features are:

* Named constructor tear-off (examples: `var mkAnyList = List.filled`, `List<String> Function(int, String) mkStringList = List.filled`.)
  * Directly and through (some) type aliases.
* Named unnamed constructor (`C.new` is a name for the "unnamed" `C` constructor).
  * Which then allows for tear-off without conflicting with type literal syntax.
* Explicit instantiation of:
  * Type literals (Example: `Type intList = List<int>;`)
  * Function tear-offs (Example: `var intId = id<int>;`)
* Implicit and explicit instantiation of function values (not just at tear-off).
  * `var id = <T>(T value) => value; int Function(int) intId = id;` (implicit).
  * `var intId = id<int>;` (explicit).

The new syntax causes some ambiguities in the grammar, which we resolve by a one-token lookahead after a potential type argument list.

### Named constructor tear-off

We allow tearing off named constructors.

If *C* denotes a class declaration (it's an identifier or qualified identifier which resolves to the class declaration) and *C.name* is the name of a constructor of that class, we allow you to tear off that constructors as:

* <code>*C*.*name*</code>, or
* <code>*C*\<*typeArgs*>.*name*</code>

just as you can currently invoke the constructor as <code>*C*.*name*(*args*)</code>, or <code>*C*\<*typeArgs*>.*name*(*args*)</code>.

_These expressions can be constant, as specified in the section about constant expressions._

_The syntax without type arguments is currently allowed by the language grammar, but is rejected by the static semantics as not being a valid expression when denoting a constructor. The syntax with type arguments is not currently grammatically an expression. Both can occur as part of a constructor invocation, but cannot be expressions by themselves because they have no values. We introduce a static and dynamic expression semantics for such a *named constructor tear-off expression*, which makes them valid expressions._

A named constructor tear-off expression of one of the forms above evaluates to a function value which could be created by tearing off a *corresponding constructor function*, which would be a static function defined on the class denoted by *C*, with a fresh name here represented by adding `$tearoff`:

> <code>static *C* *name*$tearoff\<*typeParams*>(*params*) => *C*\<*typeArgs*>.*name*(*args*);</code>

If *C* is not generic, then <code>\<*typeParams*\></code> and <code>\<*typeArgs*\></code> are omitted. Otherwise <code>\<*typeParams*\></code> are exactly the same type parameters as those of the class declaration of *C* (including bounds), and <code>\<*typeArgs*></code> applies those type parameter variables directly as type arguments to *C*.

Similarly, <code>*params*</code> is *almost* exactly the same parameter list as the constructor *C*.*name*, with the one exception that *initializing formals* are represented by normal parameters with the same name and type. All remaining properties of the parameters are the same as for the corresponding constructor parameter, including any default values, and *args* is an argument list passing those parameters to `C.name` directly as they are received.

For example, `Uri.http` evaluates to an expression which could have been created by tearing off a corresponding static function declaration:

```dart
static Uri http$tearoff(String authority, String unencodedPath, [Map<String, dynamic>? queryParameters]) =>
    Uri.http(authority, unencodedPath, queryParameters);
```

and a constructor of a generic class, like `List.filled`, would be:

```6dart
static List<E> filled$tearoff<E>(int count, E fill) => List<E>.filled(count, fill);
```

When tearing off a *constructor of a generic class* using <code>*C*.*name*</code>, the type arguments may be implicitly instantiated, just as for a normal generic method tear-off of the corresponding static function. The instantiation is based on the context-type at the tear-off position. If the context types allows a generic function, the tear-off is not instantiated and the result is a generic function.

When tearing off a constructor of a generic class using <code>*C*\<*typeArgs*>.*name*</code>, the torn off method is *always* instantiated to the provided type arguments (which must be valid type arguments for the class/corresponding function). It otherwise behaves as an implicitly instantiated function tear-off.

The constant-ness, identity and equality of the torn-off constructor functions behave exactly the same as if they were tear-offs of the corresponding static function. This means that a non-generic class constructor always tears off to the *same* function value, as does an uninstantiated tear off of a generic class constructor. An instantiated tear-off is constant and canonicalized if the instantiating types are constant, and behaves like any other static method tear-off when the types are not constant.

The static type of the named constructor tear-off expression is the same as the static type of the corresponding constructor function tear-off.

_We effectively desugar constructor tear-off into static method tear-off of a corresponding static function, which ensures that the behavior of constructor tear-offs is consistent with the behavior of static method tear-offs._

The new syntactic options introduce an **ambiguity** in the grammar. If `List.filled` is a valid expression, then `List.filled(4, 4)` can both be a constructor invocation *and* a tear-off followed by a function invocation, and `List.filled<int>(4, 4)` can *only* be valid as a tear-off followed by a function invocation.
This is similar to the existing possible ambiguity for an instance method invocation like `o.m(arg)`, and we resolve it the same way, by always preferring the direct invocation over doing a tear-off and a function invocation.

We do not allow a constructor invocation of the form `List.filled<int>(4, 4)` at all.  We could allow it, it's syntactically similar to a getter invocation like `o.getter<int>(4)`, which we do handle without issues, but allowing that syntax, which would necessarily then be a constructor tear-off as the function of a function value invocation, could interfere with a possible later introduction of *generic constructors*. We only do constructor tear-off when the constructor reference is *not* followed by a *typeArguments* or *arguments* production. If it is followed by those, then it's a constructor *invocation*, and it's currently an error if a named constructor invocation includes type arguments after the name. That is, the  expression `List.filled<int>(4, 4)` is *invalid*, it's not interpreted as a constructor tear-off followed by a function invocation, but always as a constructor invocation&mdash;and the `List.filled` constructor is not a generic construct (no constructor is, yet). You can write `(List.filled)<int>(4, 4)` to do the tear-off or `List<int>.filled(4, 4)` to do the invocation.

#### Tearing off constructors from type aliases

*With generalized type-aliases*, it's possible to declare a class-alias like `typedef IntList = List<int>;`. We allow calling constructors on such a type alias, so we will also allow tearing off those constructors.

Example class aliases:

```dart
typedef IntList                   = List<int>; // Non-generic alias.
typedef NumList<T extends num>    = List<T>;   // Generic alias.
typedef MyList<T extends dynamic> = List<T>;   // Generic alias *and* "proper rename" of List.
```

When a type alias aliases a class (or a mixin, if or when we choose to allow factory constructors in mixin declarations), we can introduce a corresponding constructor function for the alias for each constructor of the class. Those corresponding constructor functions are declared next to the alias (a top-level declaration) and with a fresh name. If an alias has the form <code>typedef *A*\<*typeParams*> = *C*\<*typeArgs*>;</code>, and *C* declares a constructor <code>*C*.*name*(params) &hellip;</code>, then the *alias* has a corresponding constructor function

```dart
C<typeArgs> A$name$tearoff<typeParams>(params) => C<typeArgs>.name(args);
```

where *args* passes the parameters *params* directly to as arguments to *C.name* in the same order they are received. As usual, if *A* is not generic, the \<*typeParams*> are omitted, and if *C* is not generic, \<*typeArgs*> are going to be absent. This constructor function is *only* used for *generic* tear-offs of the constructor, and only if the alias is not a "proper rename", as defined below. In all other cases, a tear-off of a constructor through an alias will use the corresponding constructor function of the aliased class directly.

For the example aliases above, the constructor functions corresponding to `List.filled` would be:

```dart
List<int> IntList$filled$tearoff(int length, int value) =>
    List<int>.filled(length, value);
List<T> NumList$filled$tearoff<T extends num>(int length, T value) =>
    List<T>.filled(length, value);
List<T> MyList$filled$tearoff<T extends dynamic>(int length, T value) =>
    List<T>.filled(length, value);
```

However, those constructor functions are not necessarily all *used*, because we prefer to use the constructor functions of the class where possible. This reduces the number of functions the compiler actually has to introduce.

For static typing and type inference, the tear-off of a constructor from an alias is always equivalent to tearing off the corresponding constructor function of the alias. The static type of the tear-off expression is the static type of that function tear-off. Inferred type arguments that would be applied to that function tear-off are then applied to the alias in order to decide the run-time semantics. Example:

```dart
List<int> Function(int, int) f = NumList.filled;
// equivalent for inference:   = NumList$filled$tearoff;
// Infers type argument <int>: = NumList$filled$tearoff<int>;
// equivalent to writing:      = NumList<int>.filled;
```

For the run-time semantics we may tear off *either* the corresponding constructor function of the alias *or*, preferably, the corresponding constructor function of the class when we know that it has a compatible type and behavior. The choices are as follows:

**Tearing off a constructor from a non-generic alias for a class is equivalent to tearing off the constructor from the aliased class (which is instantiated by the alias if the class is generic).**

A *non-generic* type alias is always expanded to its aliased type, then the tear-off happens at that type. Tearing off `IntList.filled` will act like tearing off `List<int>.filled`, which uses the corresponding constructor function of `List`. It's constant and canonicalized to the same function as `List<int>.filled`. _In other words, the alias is treated as an actual alias for the type it aliases._ The `IntList$filled$tearoff` constructor is never used for anything because the alias is non-generic.

Example:

```dart
var f = IntList.filled; // Equivalent to `List<int>.filled` or `List.filled$tearoff<int>`
```

**Tearing off a constructor from an instantiated generic alias for a class is equivalent to tearing off the constructor from the aliased class (which is instantiated by the instantiated alias if the class is generic, which it probably is since otherwise the alias doesn't use its type parameter).**

A *generic* type alias is not an alias for *one* type, but for a family of types. If the type alias is *instantiated* (implicitly or explicitly) before the tear-off, then the result is still the same as tearing the constructor off the aliased type directly, using the corresponding constructor function of the class, and it's constant and canonicalized if the instantiating type arguments are compile-time constant types.

Example:

```dart
// Equivalent to `List<int>.filled` or `List.filled$tearoff<int>`
var makeIntList = NumList<int>.filled;
// Same as `List<double>.filled` after inference.
List<double> Function(int, double) makeDoubleList = NumList.filled;
```

Here `NumList<int>` is a single type (`List<int>`), and the tear-off happens from that type.

Notice that whether an alias expansion is constant depends on the parameters, not the result. Example:

```dart
typedef Ignore2<T, S> = List<T>;
void foo<X>() {
  var c = Ignore2<int, X>.filled; // Aka. List<int>.filled, but is *not constant*.
}
```

In this example, `Ignore2<int, X>.filled` is treated exactly like `List<Y>.filled` where `Y` happens to be bound to `int` when the expression is evaluated. There is no canonicalization. Such a situation, where a type alias has parameters it does not use, is expected to be extremely rare.

**If the generic alias is not a proper rename for the class it aliases, then tearing off a constructor from the uninstantiated alias is equivalent to tearing off the corresponding constructor function of the alias, which is a generic function. The result always a generic function, and is always a compile-time constant.**

If the generic alias is *not* instantiated before the constructor is torn off, then the tear-off abstracts over the type parameters *of the alias*, and tearing off a constructor works equivalently to tearing off the corresponding constructor function *of the alias* (where the generics match the type alias, not the underlying class). This is where we use the corresponding constructor function of the alias&mdash;except when the alias is a *proper rename*, as defined below.

Example:

```dart
var makeNumList = NumList.filled;  // Equivalent to NumList$filled$tearoff
```

Since this is equivalent to the uninstantiated tear-off of a static/top-level function, it's always constant and canonicalized.

Example:

```dart
typedef ListList<T> = List<List<T>>;
// Corresponding factory function
List<List<T>> ListList$filled$tearoff<T>(int length, List<T> value) =>
  List<List<T>>.filled(length, value);
var f = ListList.filled; // Equivalent to `= ListList$filled$tearoff;`
```

**If a generic alias is a proper rename for a class, then tearing off a constructor from the uninstantiated alias is equivalent to tearing off the corresponding constructor function of the *class*. This is always a generic function, and is always a compile-time constant.**

An alias is considered a *proper rename* of a class if the type alias aliases the class, its has the same number of type parameters as the class, the type parameters have the same bounds as the corresponding parameter of the class, and the type parameters are directly passed as type arguments to the class in the order they are declared. More formally:

A type alias of the form <code>typedef *A*\<*X*<sub>1</sub> extends *P*<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;,  *X*<sub>*n*</sub> extends *P*<sub>*n*</sub>\> = *C*<*x*<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, *x*<sub>*n*</sub>\></code> is a *proper rename* of a class <code>class C \<*Y*<sub>1</sub> extends *Q*<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;,  *Y*<sub>*m*</sub> extends *Q*<sub>*m*</sub>\> &hellip;</code> iff:

* <code>*C*</code> denotes the class declaration of `C`,
* *n* = *m*.
* *P*<sub>*i*</sub>[*X*<sub>1</sub>&mapsto;*Y*<sub>1</sub>, &hellip; *X*<sub>*n*</sub>&mapsto;*Y*<sub>*n*</sub>] and *Q*<sub>*i*</sub> are mutual subtypes for all 1 &le; *i* &le; *n*.

That is, an alias is not a proper rename if it accepts different type parameters than the class it aliases, whether it be the bounds, the order, or even the number of type parameters.

Example:

```dart
class C<T1 extends num, T2 extends Object?> {}
// Proper rename, bounds are mutual subtypes:
typedef A1<X extends num, Y extends dynamic> = C<X, Y>;
// Not proper rename! Different bound:
typedef A1<X extends num, Y extends num> = C<X, Y>;
// Not proper rename! Different order:
typedef A1<X extends Object?, Y extends num> = C<Y, X>;
// Not proper rename! Different count:
typedef A1<X extends num> = C<X, Object?>;
```

If *A* is a proper rename for *C*, then a constructor tear-off <code>*A.name*</code> tears off the corresponding constructor function for <code>*C.name*</code> instead of the one for <code>*A.name*</code>. The static type is still the same as it would be for <code>*A.name*</code>, the only difference is the identity of the resulting function and the actual reified type parameter bounds, which are only guaranteed to be equivalent up to mutual subtyping, which may be visible if someone does `toString` on the runtime type of something containing those types. _The requirements of a proper rename ensures that the run-time behavior of the function will be nigh indistinguishable from the corresponding constructor function of the alias._

Example :

```dart
var f = MyList.filled; // Equivalent to `List.filled` or `List.filled$tearoff`

// Instantiated type aliases use the aliased type,
// and are constant and canonicalized when the type is constant.
print(identical(MyList<int>.filled, NumList<int>.filled)); // true
print(identical(MyList<int>.filled, List<int>.filled)); // true
print(identical(NumList<int>.filled, List<int>.filled)); // true

// Non-instantiated type aliases have their own generic function.
print(identical(MyList.filled, MyList.filled)); // true
print(identical(NumList.filled, NumList.filled)); // true
print(identical(MyList.filled, NumList.filled)); // false
print(identical(MyList.filled, List.filled)); // true (proper rename!)

// Implicitly instantiated tear-off.
List<int> Function(int, int) myList = MyList.filled;
List<int> Function(int, int) numList = NumList.filled;

// Same as `MyList<int>.filled` vs `NumList<int>.filled`.
print(identical(myList, numList)); // true
```

The static type of a proper-rename alias constructor tear-off may differ from its runtime type, because the static type is taken from the alias, the runtime type is taken from the aliased class.

Example:

```dart
class C<T extends Object?> {
  C.name();
  List<T> createList() => <T>[];
}
// Proper rename, different, but equivalent, bound.
typedef A<T extends dynamic> = C<T>;
void main() {
  // Static type : C<T> Function<T extends Object?>()
  // Runtime type: C<T> Function<T extends Object?>()
  var cf = C.name;
  // Static type : C<T> Function<T extends dynamic>()
  // Runtime type: C<T> Function<T extends Object?>()
  var af = A.name;
  var co = (cf as dynamic)();
  var ao = (af as dynamic)();
  // Dynamic instantiate to bounds uses actual bounds.
  print(co.runtimeType); // C<Object?>
  print(ao.runtimeType); // C<Object?>
}
```

### Unnamed constructor tear-off

If *C* denotes a class, an expression of *C* by itself already has a meaning, it evaluates to a `Type` object representing the class, so it cannot also denote the unnamed constructor.

Because of that, we introduce a *new* syntax that can be used to denote the unnamed constructor: <code>*C*.new</code>. It can be used in every place where a named constructor can be referenced, but will instead denote the unnamed constructor, *and* it can be used to tear off the unnamed constructor without interfering with using the class name to denote the `Type` object.

```dart
class C {
  final int x;
  const C.new(this.x); // declaration.
}
class D extend C {
  D(int x) : super.new(x * 2); // super constructor reference.
}
void main() {
  D.new(1); // normal invocation.
  const C.new(1); // const invocation.
  new C.new(1); // explicit new invocation.
  var f = C.new; // tear-off.
  f(1);
}
```

Apart from the tear-off, this code will mean exactly the same thing as the same code without the `.new`. The tear-off cannot be performed without the `.new` because that expression already means something else.

*With regard to tear-offs, <code>C.new</code> works exactly as if it had been a named constructor, with a corresponding constructor function named <code>C.new$tearoff</code>.*

We probably want to support `[C.new]` as a constructor link in DartDoc as well. In `dart:mirrors`, the name of the constructor is still just `C`, not `C.new` (we don't want to break existing reflection using code).

The grammar will be changed to allow ``<identifier> |`new'`` anywhere we currently denote a named constructor name, and we make it a `<primary>` expression to tear-off an unnamed constructor as `classRef.new`.

You cannot have both a `C` and a `C.new` constructor declaration in the same class, they denote the same constructor, so we ensure that by adding (in appropriate places):

> A constructor declaration with declared name <code>*C*.new</code> declares a constructor named <code>*C*</code>.

and

> If *C* denotes a class, <code>*C*.new</code> denotes a constructor named *C* of that class.

The `.new` is entirely *syntax* for denoting an unnamed constructor, it is not a new *name* in the program.

It's still not allowed to have two constructor declarations with the same name, so declarations of <code>*C*</code> and <code>*C*.new</code> introduce a conflict because both constructors have the same name, *C*.

### Explicitly instantiated classes and functions

The above named constructor tear-off feature allows you to explicitly instantiate a constructor tear-off as `List<int>.filled`. We do not have a similar ability to explicitly instantiate function tear-offs. Currently you have to provide a context type and rely on *implicit instantiation* if you want to tear off an instantiated version of a generic function.

We can also use type aliases to define instantiated interface types, but we cannot do the same thing in-line.

Example:

```dart
T id<T>(T value) => value;
int Function(int) idInt = id; // Implicitly instantiated tear-off.
// and
typedef IntList = List<int>;
Type intList = IntList;
```

This feature introduces syntax to explicitly instantiate a generic function object or tear-off and a type literal for a generic type. The former for consistency with constructor tear-offs, the latter to introduce in-line types without needing a `typedef`, like we did for in-line function types originally. We introduce both now because they share the same grammar productions.

Example:

```dart
T id<T>(T value) => value;
var idInt = id<int>; // Explicitly instantiated tear-off, saves on function types.
// and
Type intList = List<int>; // In-line instantiated type literal.
```

These grammar changes allow *type parameters* without following parenthesized arguments in places where we previously did not allow that. This means that `<typeArguments>` becomes a *selector* by itself, not just when followed by arguments.

Explicit instantiation applies to any function value, whether tear-offs of instance methods or local, static and top-level function declarations, or first-class function values.

For an expression of the form <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code>, which is not followed by an argument list (that would turn it into a generic function invocation), the meaning of <code>*e*\<typeArgs></code> depends on the expression *e*:

* If *e* denotes a generic class, mixin or type alias declaration (which means that *e* is an identifier, possibly a qualified identifier, which resolves to the class, mixin or type alias declaration), then <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code> is a type literal. _If followed by <code>.*id*</code> then that *id* must denote a constructor, which can then be either torn off or invoked. If followed by `==` or `!=` or any "stop-token", the expression evaluates to a `Type` object._
* If *e* denotes a generic top-level, static or local function declaration (again *e* is an identifier or qualified identifier), that declaration must be a generic function declaration, and then <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code> performs an explicitly instantiated function tear-off, which works just like the current implicitly instantiated function tear-off except that the types are provided instead of inferred.
* If *e* denotes a generic instance method (*e* has the form <code>*r*.*name*</code> and *r* has a static type for which *name* is a generic interface method), then <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code> performs an explicitly instantiated method tear-off, which works just like the current implicitly instantiated method tear-off except that the types are provided instead of inferred.
* If *e* has a static type which is a generic callable object type (a non-function type with a generic method named `call`), then <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code> is equivalent to the instantiated method-tear off <code>*e*\.call<*typeArgs*></code>.
* Otherwise, if *e* has a static type which is a generic function type, then <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code> is equivalent to the instantiated method-tear off <code>*e*\.call<*typeArgs*></code>.
* Otherwise the expression is a compile-time error.
  * This includes *e* having the static type `dynamic` or `Function`. We do not support implicit or explicit instantiation of functions where we do not know the number and bounds of the type parameters at compile-time.
  * It also includes *e* denoting a constructor. _(We reserve this syntax for denoting instantiation of generic constructors, should the language add [generic constructors](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/647) in the future. Instead just write <code>(*C*.*name*)\<*typeArgs*\></code> or <code>*C*\<typeArgs\>.*name*</code>.)_

Cascades can contain explicitly instantiated tearoffs, because they can contain any selector and instantiation is now a selector, e.g., `receiver..foo()..instanceMethod<int>..bar`. _Note that this example is allowed for consistency, but it will compute a value and discard it. Instantiation without immediate invocation is expected to be primarily used in places where the value of that instantiation will be stored for later use, and using it in a cascade is outside of that usage pattern. One example where it could be useful would be as a receiver for an extension method on function types, like  `receiver..foo()..bar<int>.apply(argList)`. The first selector of a cascade section must still be one of `..identifier` or `..[index]`, it cannot be `..<typeArgs>` any more than it can be `..(argumentList)`._

```dart
class A {
  List<X> m<X>(X x) => [x];
}

extension FunctionApplier on Function {
  void applyAndPrint(List<Object?> positionalArguments) =>
      print(Function.apply(this, positionalArguments, const {}));
}

void main() {
  A()
    ..m<int>.applyAndPrint([2])
    ..m<String>.applyAndPrint(['three']);
}
```

The static type of the explicitly instantiated tear-offs are the same as if the type parameter had been inferred, but no longer depends on the context type. Missing type arguments in implicit instantiation expressions can now be considered "filled in" by type inference, as if they had been written explicitly, just as for other inferred type arguments.

The static type of the instantiated type literal is `Type`. This feature also satisfies issue [#123](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/123).

As mentioned above, we **do not allow** *dynamic* explicit instantiation. If an expression `e` has type `dynamic` (or `Never` or `Function` ), then <code>e\<typeArgs></code> is a **compile-time error**. It's not possible to do implicit instantiation without knowing the member signature to some extent, and we also don't allow explicit instantiation. _(Possible alternative: Allow it, and handle it all at run-time, including any errors from having the wrong number or types of arguments, or just not existing at all. We won't do this for now.)_

We **now allow** both implicit and explicit instantiation of *callable objects* (objects with an interface type which has a `call` method) when their `call` method is generic.

Previously, the following code was invalid:

```dart
class Id {
  T call<T>(T value) => value;
}
int Function(int) intId = Id();
```

We disallowed this code because callable objects were treated like function *objects*, and we did not allow implicit instantiation of function objects, only tear-offs. Even if `call` is an instance method, and we allowed implicit instantiation of instance methods tear-offs, we chose to ignore that here and treat the callable object as a function object. _(We also implicitly allowed instantiating the `call` method of actual function values, but it didn't work on all our implementations.)_

We now allow instantiating function objects, and therefore we do not need to restrict callable objects either.

The variable initialization above will, after type inference, be

```dart
int Function(int) intId = Id().call<int>;
```

Also, we allow explicitly instantiating a callable object:

```dart
var intId = Id()<int>;
```

is also type-inferred to the same initialization.

**That is**, given an expression of the form <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code>, if *e* has a static type which is a callable object, the expression is equivalent to <code>*e*\.call<*typeArgs*></code>. Since no object with an interface type can otherwise support type-instantiation, this coercion turns an error into useful code, and allows a typed callable object to be consistently treated like a function object equivalent to its `call` method.

### Grammar Ambiguities

This new syntax also introduces **new ambiguities** in the grammar, similar to the one we introduced with generic functions. Examples include:

```dart
f(a<b,c>(d)); // Existing ambiguity, resolved to a generic method call.
f(x.a<b,c>[d]); // f((x.a<b, c>)[d]) or f((x.a < b), (c > [d]))
f(x.a<b,c>-d);  // f((x.a<b, c>)-d) or f((x.a < b), (c > -d]))
```

The `x.a<b,c>` can be an explicitly instantiated generic function tear-off or an explicitly instantiated type literal named using a prefix, which is new. While neither type objects nor functions declare `operator-` or `operator[]`, such could be added using extension methods.

We will disambiguate such situations *heuristically* based on the token following the `>` that matches the `<` we are ambiguous about. In the existing ambiguity we treat `(` as a sign that the `<` starts a generic invocation. We extend the number of tokens which, when following a potential type argument list, makes us choose to parse the previous tokens as that type argument list.

There is a number of tokens which very consistently *end* an expression, and we include all those:

> `)`, `}`, `]`, `;`, `:`, `,`

Then we include tokens which we *predict* will continue a generic instantiation:

>  `(`  `.`  `==`  `!=`

The first six are tokens which cannot possibly start an expression, and therefore cannot occur after a greater-than infix operator. The last four tokens can continue an expression, and of those only `(` can also start an expression, and we already decided how to disambiguate that).

There are many other tokens which *currently* cannot continue an expression (and therefore cannot validly follow a type argument list) or which cannot *start* an expression (and therefore cannot validly follow a greater-than operator), but in the service of keeping our future options open, we choose a design that does not rely on those restrictions. For example we omit most infix operators from being "continuation tokens", even though they *currently* cannot start a new expression, and therefore cannot follow a `>` infix operator. This leaves us open to allowing some of those operators as prefix operators in the future, like we currently allow the `-` operator.

In all cases, if a grammatically ambiguous instantiation needs to be followed by a character other than the ones above, the author can wrap the instantiation in parentheses.

Grammatically, we restrict the productions for the less-than operator and the type arguments selector as follows:

> ```ebnf
> <relationalOperator> ::= `>='
>   | `>'
>   | `<='
>   | `<' NEGATIVE_LOOKAHEAD(<typeList> `>' (<continuationToken> | <stopToken>))
>
> <selector> ::=
>       '!'
>   |   assignableSelector
>   |   argumentPart
>   |   typeArguments LOOKAHEAD(<continuationToken> | <stopToken>)
>
> <continuationToken> ::= `(' | `.' | `==' | `!='
> <stopToken> ::= `)' | `]' | `}' | `;' | `:' | `,'
> ```

That is, if a `<` occurs where it could potentially be either a type arguments list or a less than operator, absent any knowledge of the rest of the program, the parser can first try to parse it as a type argument list, then look at the following token, and if that token is one of the ones listed above, it *must* be a type argument list, because the relational less-than operator cannot possibly match due to its negative lookahead on exactly the thing that was just matched.

If the next token is not one of those characters, then the compiler can backtrack and try parsing as a relational less-than operator because the type arguments selector cannot possibly match. (If the compiler can somehow peek at the token following the matching `>` of a type arguments list before parsing the list, then it can potentially skip parsing as a type argument list entirely if the following token is not one of the chosen ones. It will have to try parsing as a type argument list for the cases where *that* part could fail to match, and thereby satisfy the negative lookahead of the relational operator, like `f(2 < 3, 4 > (5))` where the `2` and `3` are not valid type productions.

**Identity and equality** is not affected by explicit instantiation, it works exactly like if the same types had been inferred.

#### Static invocations

A static member invocation still only works on an *uninstantiated* type literal. You can write `List.copyRange`, but not `List<int>.copyRange`.

Allowing `List<int>.copyRange` is confusing. The invocation will not have access to the type parameter anyway, so allowing it is not going to help anyone. The occurrence of `List` in `List.copyRange` refers to the class *declaration*, treated as a namespace, not the class itself.

This goes for type aliases too. We can declare `typedef MyList<T> = List<T>;` and `typedef IntList = List<int>;` and do `MyList.copyRange` or `IntList.copyRange` to access the static member of *the declaration* of the type being aliased. This is specially introduced semantics for aliases of class or mixin types, not something that falls out of first resolving the type alias to the class or mixin type. We do not allow `MyList<int>.copyRange` either, even though we allow `IntList.copyRange`. They are not the same when doing static member accesses.

#### Constructor/type object member ambiguity

Until now, writing `C.foo` means that `foo` must be a static member of `C`. If you write `C.toString()`, then it's interpreted as trying to call a static `toString` method on the class `C`, not the instance `toString` method of the `Type` object for the class `C`. You have to write `(C).toString()` if that is what you want.

Similarly, we always treat `C<T>.toString()` as an attempted constructor invocation, not an invocation of the instance `toString` method of the `Type` object corresponding to `C<T>` (which is now otherwise a valid expression). It must be a static or constructor invocation since `C<T>` is a type literal, and we do not allow static invocations on instantiated type literals, so that only leaves constructors.

That is, disambiguation of the otherwise grammatically ambiguous "(instantiated class-reference or type-literal).name" always chooses the "constructor tear-off" interpretation over the "type-literal instance member" interpretation. If followed by an argument list, it's always treated as a constructor invocation, not the (now otherwise allowed) `Type` object instance method invocation. This is a generalization of what we already do for static members and for constructor invocations.

### Constructors in abstract classes

A compile-time error occurs if a constructor tear-off denotes a generative constructor declared in an abstract class.

*A generative constructor declared in an abstract class may well be executed as part of the execution of a constructor tear-off, via a superinitializer. It cannot, however, be torn off on its own, because the execution of a constructor tear-off is an instance creation, and abstract classes do not have instances. There is no similar constraint on a factory constructor.*

### Constructors in mixin application classes

A mixin application introduces *forwarding constructors* for accessible superclass constructors. Those implicitly introduced constructors are subject to constructor tear-off in the same way as if they had been declared explicitly, and they are constant expressions according to the same rules.

Example:

```dart
class A<X> {
  A.named();
  A();
}
mixin M {}
class B<X> = A<X> with M;

void main() {
  const f = B.named; // Uninstantiated tear-off.
  var g = B<int>.new; // Explicitly instantiated tear-off.
}
```

### Grammar changes

The grammar changes necessary for these changes are provided separately (as [changes to the spec grammar](https://dart-review.googlesource.com/c/sdk/+/197161)). The grammar change examples above are for illustration only.

### Constant expressions

We add the following to the set of expressions that are potentially constant or constant:

If <code>*e*</code> is a potentially constant expression derived from <code>\<primary> \<selector>*</code> and <code>*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub></code> derived from <code>\<typeList></code> is a list of potentially constant type expressions, then <code>*e*\<*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub>></code> is a potentially constant expression.
If moreover <code>*e*</code> is a constant expression whose static type is a function type <code>*F*</code> or <code>*e*</code> is a type literal, and <code>*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub></code> is a list of constant type expressions, then <code>*e*\<*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub>></code> is a constant expression.

*It follows that <code>*F*</code> is a generic function type taking <code>*k*</code> type arguments, and <code>*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub></code> satisfy the bounds of <code>*F*</code>, and similarly for the type literal, because otherwise the program would have a compile-time error.*

Assume that <code>*C*.*name*</code> denotes a constructor, and <code>*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub></code> is derived from <code>\<typeArguments></code>, for some <code>*k* >= 0</code>.
<code>*C*\<*T*<sub>*1*</sub>..*T*<sub>*k*</sub>>.*name*</code> is then a potentially constant expression if <code>*T*<sub>*j*</sub></code> is a potentially constant type expression for each <code>*j*</code>.
It is further a constant expression if <code>*T*<sub>*j*</sub></code> is a constant type expression for each <code>*j*</code>.

_In particular, <code>*C*.*name*</code>, which is the case where <code>*k* == 0</code>, is always constant when <code>*C*</code> is a non-generic class, and it may or may not be constant if it is generic and the type arguments are inferred._

If <code>*T*</code> denotes a type variable then <code>*T*</code> is a potentially constant type expression, and a potentially constant expression.

_This is just a simpler way to write something which is already supported: If we wish to use a type variable as an expression in a constant constructor initializer list, we can define <code>typedef F\<X> = X;</code> and express the same thing as <code>F\<T></code>._

*Section 'Tearing off constructors from type aliases' specifies several additional cases, all saying that a tearoff from a type alias is constant if and only if the corresponding constructor function tearoff is constant.
This is specified about non-generic type aliases; about generic type aliases that are applied to some actual type arguments; about generic type aliases that are 'proper renames' and that do not receive any actual type arguments; and about generic type aliases that are not 'proper renames' and do not receive any actual type arguments.*

## Summary

We allow `TypeName.name` and `TypeName<typeArgs>.name`, when not followed by a type argument list or function argument list, as expressions which creates tear-offs of the constructor `TypeName.name`.  The `TypeName` can refer to a class declaration or to a type alias declaration which aliases a class.

```dart
typedef ListList<T> = List<List<T>>;
const filledList = List.filled;  // List<T> Function<T>(int, T)
const filledIntList = List<int>.filled;  // List<int> Function(int, int)
const filledListList = ListList.filled;  // List<List<T>> Function<T>(int, T)
const filledIntListList = ListList<int>.filled;  // List<List<int>> Function(int, int)
```

We allow `TypeName.new` and `TypeName<typeArgs>.new` everywhere we allow a reference to a named constructor. It instead refers to the unnamed constructor. We allow tear-offs of the unnamed constructor by using `.new` and then treating it as a named constructor tear-off. Examples:

```dart
class C<T> {
  final T x;
  const C.new(this.x); // Same as: `const C(this.x);`
  C.other(T x) : this.new(x); // Same as: `: this(x)`
  factory C.d(T x) = D<T>.new;  // same as: `= D<T>;`
}

class D<T> extends C<T> {
  const D(T x) : super.new(x); // Same as: `: super(x);`
}

void main() {
  const C.new(0); // Same as: `const C(0);`. (Inferred `T` = `int`.)
  const C<num>.new(0); // Same as: `const C<num>(0);`.
  new C.new(0); // Same as `new C(0);`.
  new C<num>.new(0); // Same as `new C<num>(0);`.
  C.new(0); // Same as `C(0);`.
  C<num>.new(0); // Same as `C<num>(0);`.
  var f1 = C.new; // New tear-off, not expressible without `.new`.
  var f2 = C<num>.new; // New tear-off, not expressible without `.new`.
}
```

We allow *explicit instantiation* of tear-offs and type literals, by allowing type arguments where we would otherwise do implicit instantiation of tear-offs, or after type literals. Examples:

```dart
typedef ListList<T> = List<List<T>>;
T top<T>(T value) => value;
class C {
  static T stat<T>(T value) => value;
  T inst<T>(T value) => value;
  void method() {
    var f1 = stat<int>;
    var f1TypeName = stat<int>.runtimeType.toString();
    var f2 = inst<int>;
    var f2TypeName = inst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
    var f3 = this.inst<int>;
    var f3TypeName = this.inst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
  }
}
mixin M on C {
  static T mstat<T>(T value) => value;
  T minst<T>(T value) => value;
  void mmethod() {
    var f1 = mstat<int>;
    var f1TypeName = mstat<int>.runtimeType.toString();
    var f2 = minst<int>;
    var f2TypeName = minst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
    var f3 = this.minst<int>;
    var f3TypeName = this.minst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
  }
}
extension Ext on C {
  static T estat<T>(T value) => value;
  T einst<T>(T value) => value;
  void emethod() {
    var f1 = estat<int>; // Works like (int $) => Ext.estat<int>($)
    var f1TypeName = estat<int>.runtimeType.toString();
    var f2 = einst<int>; // Works like (int $) => Ext(this).einst<int>($)
    var f2TypeName = einst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
    var f3 = this.einst<int>; // Works like (int $) => Ext(this).einst<int>($)
    var f3TypeName = this.einst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
  }
}
class D extends C with M {
  void method() {
    var f4 = super.inst<int>; // works like (int $) => super.inst<int>($)
    var f4TypeName = super.inst<int>.runtimeType.toString();
  }
}
void main() {
  // Type literals.
  var t1 = List<int>; // Type object for `List<int>`.
  var t2 = ListList<int>; // Type object for `List<List<int>>`.

  // Instantiated function tear-offs.
  T local<T>(T value) => value;
  const f1 = top<int>; // int Function(int), works like (int $) => top<int>($);
  const f2 = C.stat<int>; // int Function(int), works like (int $) => C.stat<int>($);
  var f3 = local<int>; // int Function(int), works like (int $) => local<int>($);
  var d = D();
  var f4 = d.inst<int>; // int Function(int), works like (int $) => c.inst<int>($);
  var f5 = d.minst<int>; // int Function(int), works like (int $) => c.minst<int>($);
  var f6 = d.einst<int>; // int Function(int), works like (int $) => Ext(c).einst<int>($);
  var typeName = List<int>.toString();
  var functionTypeName = local<int>.runtimeType.toString();
}
```

We allow instantiating non-tear-off function values and callable objects.

```dart
T func<T>(T value) => value;
var funcValue = func;
int Function(int) f = funcValue; // Implicitly instantiated.
var f = funcValue<int>; // Explicitly instantiated.

class Id {
  T call<T>(T value) => value;
}
int Function(int) f = Id(); // Implicit instantiation of `Id().call`.
var g = Id()<int>; // Equivalent to `Id().call<int>`
```

Such value instantiation uses the static type of the function for the type arguments, but forwards the actual arguments to the instantiated function value.

That makes a type instantiation expression of the form <code>*e*\<*typeArgs*></code> only allowed if *e* denotes

* a generic type declaration (class, mixin, type alias) and then the result is an instantiated type literal.
* a generic function declaration (top-level, static or local),
* an instance method whose static type is a generic function type, or
* any other expression which evaluates to a generic function, in which case the result is a non-generic function value.

When followed by an argument list, we do instantiated invocation (of the unnamed constructor for types) instead of instantiation.

#### Grammar production differences

Our grammar is not as orthogonal as one could hope, mainly for historical reasons.

If *C* denotes a generic class with a constructor `name` and a static generic method `staticMethod` then:

* <code>*C*.name</code> is valid and denotes a generic function.
* <code>*C*\<int>.name</code> is valid and denotes a non-generic function.
* <code>*C*.name\<int></code> is invalid (constructors are not generic).
* <code>*C*.staticMethod</code> is valid and denotes a generic function.
* <code>*C*\<int>.staticMethod</code> is invalid. We do not allow static members through instantiated types.
* <code>*C*\.staticMethod\<int></code> is valid and denotes a non-generic function.
* <code>*C*?.name</code> is invalid, we do not allow that syntax to denote a constructor tear-off.
* <code>*C*?.staticMethod</code> is valid and denotes a generic function.
* <code>*C*..name</code> is invalid unless `name` is also a member of `Type`. Cascades on type literals act on the `Type` value.
* <code>*C*..staticMethod</code> is also invalid since no instance member of `Type` has the same name as a static method. Static methods cannot have the same name as members of `Object`.

if *A* is defined as `typedef A = C<int>;` then <code>*A*.staticMethod</code> is valid, even though <code>*C*\<int>.staticMethod</code> is not. Static invocation through an alias is special in that it actually *ignores* type arguments and treats the alias as also being a "class declaration alias" for the underlying class.

### Consequences

This proposal is non-breaking and backwards compatible. Where we introduce new syntactic ambiguities, we retain the current interpretation.

It introduces new syntax for "unnamed" constructors, they are now "`new`-named" constructors, you can just omit the `new` in most cases except tear-offs. This avoids conflicting with type literals when trying to tear off an unnamed constructor.

We technically only need the `C.new` for tear-offs, and don't need to allow it in other places, but it would be (more) inconsistent to only allow the syntax in one place. Also, the same syntax may be useful for declaring and calling generic unnamed constructors in the future.

We make the tear-off of the constructor of a generic class be a generic function. *However*, we also want to introduce *generic constructors*, say `Map.fromIterable<T>(Iterable<T> elements, K key(T element), V value(T element))`, and tearing off that should also create a generic function. Making generic tear-offs work with the *class* type parameters could interfere with this later feature. The most obvious solution is to combine class and constructor type parameters when tearing off a constructor, so the tear-off function of `Map.fromIterable` could become `Map<K, V> fromIterable$tearoff<K, V, T>(…)`. The issue with that is that *making* the constructor generic would be a breaking change, it changes the number of type parameters of the tear-off `Map.fromIterable`, whereas making a previously non-generic function into a generic one is not breaking for existing invocations (they'll infer the type arguments).

Constructors with very large argument lists will create very large function closures. Example:

```dart
class C {
  final int? a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m;
  C({this.a, this.b, this.c, this.d, this.e, this.f, this.g, this.h, this.i, this.j,
     this.k, this.l, this.m});
  // Has corresponding constructor function:
  static C new$tearoff({
      int? a, int? b, int? c, int? d, int? e, int? f, int? g, int? h, int? i, int? j,
      int? k, int? l, int? m}) =>
    C(a: a, b: b, c: c, d: d, e: e, f: f, g: g, h: h, j: j, l: l, m: m);
}

...
  void Function() f = C.new; // closure of new$tearoff
```

In this case, most of the parameters are *unnecessary*, and a tear-off expression of `() => C()` would likely be sufficient. However, that would prevent canonicalization, and would be inconsistent with what we do for function tear-off. If the implementation is just a tear-off of an implicitly defined `new$tearoff`, which can be tree-shaken if the constructor is never torn off, then the overhead should be *fixed*. It will make it harder to tree-shake unused *parameters*, but no harder than for static functions, which are already torn off.

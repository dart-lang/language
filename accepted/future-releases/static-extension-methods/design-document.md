# Dart Static Extension Methods Design

lrn@google.com<br>Version: 1.0<br>Status: Design Proposal

This is a design document for *static extension methods* for Dart. This document describes the most basic variant of the feature, then lists a few possible variants or extensions.

See [Problem Description](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/40) and [Feature Request](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/41) for background.

The design of this feature is kept deliberately simple, while still attempting to make extension methods act similarly to instance methods in most cases.

## What Are Static Extension Methods

Dart classes have virtual methods. An invocation like `thing.doStuff()` will invoke the virtual `doStuff` method on the object denoted by `thing`. The only way to add methods to a class is to modify the class. If you are not the author of the class, you have to use static helper functions instead of methods, so `doMyStuff(thing)` instead of `thing.doMyStuff()`. That's acceptable for a single function, but in a larger chain of operations, it becomes overly cumbersome. Example:

```dart
doMyOtherStuff(doMyStuff(something.doStuff()).doOtherStuff())
```

That code is much less readable than:

```dart
something.doStuff().doMyStuff().doOtherStuff().doMyOtherStuff()
```

The code is also much less discoverable. An IDE can suggest `doMyStuff()` after `something.doStuff().`, but will be unlikely to suggest putting `doMyOtherStuff(…)` around the expression.

For these discoverability and readability reasons, static extension methods will allow you to add "extension methods", which are really just static functions, to existing types, and allow you to discover and call those methods as if they were actual methods, using `.`-notation. It will not add any new abilities to the language which are not already available, they just require a more cumbersome and less discoverable syntax to reach.

The extension methods are *static*, which means that we use the static type of an expression to figure out which method to call, and that also means that static extension methods are not virtual methods.

The methods we allow you to add this way are normal methods, operators, getter and setters.

## Declaring Static Extension Methods

### Syntax

A static extension of a type is declared using syntax like:

```dart
extension MyFancyList<T> on List<T> {
  int get doubleLength => this.length * 2;
  List<T> operator-() => this.reversed.toList();
  List<List<T>> split(int at) => 
      <List<T>>[this.sublist(0, at), this.sublist(at)];
  List<T> mapToList<R>(R Function(T) convert) => this.map(convert).toList();
}
```

More precisely, an extension declaration is a top-level declaration with a grammar similar to:

```ebnf
<extension> ::= 
  `extension' <identifier>? <typeParameters>? `on' <type> `?'? `{'
     memberDeclaration*
  `}'
```

Such a declaration introduces its *name* (the identifier) into the surrounding scope. The name does not denote a type, but it can be used to denote the extension itself in various places. The name can be hidden or shown in `import` or `export` declarations.

The *type* can be any valid Dart type, including a single type variable. It can refer to the type parameters of the extension. It can be followed by `?` which means that it allows `null` values. When Dart gets non-nullable types by default (NNBD), this `?` syntax is removed and subsumed by nullable types like `int?` being allowed in the `<type>` position.

The member declarations can be any non-abstract static or instance member declaration except for instance variables and constructors. Abstract members are not allowed since the extension declaration does not introduce an interface, and constructors are not allowed because the extension declaration doesn't introduce any type that can be constructed. Instance variables are not allowed because there won't be any memory allocation per instance that the extension applies to. We could implement instance variables using an `Expando`, but it would necessarily be nullable, so it would still not be an actual instance variable.

### Omitting Names For Local Extensions

If an extension declaration is only used locally in a library, there is no need to worry about naming conflicts or overrides. In that case, then name identifier can be omitted (hence the `<identifier>?` in the grammar above).

Example:

```dart
extension<T> on List<T> {
  void quadruple() { ... }
}
```

This is equivalent to giving the extension a fresh private name.

We may need to make `on` a built-in identifier, and not allow those as names of extensions, then there should not be any parsing issue. Even without that, the grammar should be unambiguous because `extension on on on { … }` and `extension on on { … }` are distinguishable, and the final type cannot be empty. It may be *harder* to parse, though.

This is a simple feature, but with very low impact. It only allows you to omit a single private name for an extension that is only used in a single library.

### Scope

Dart's static extension methods are *scoped*. They only apply to code that the extension itself is accessible to. Being accessible means that using the extension's name must denote the extension. The extension is not in scope if another declaration with the same name shadows the extension, if the extension's library is not imported, if the library is imported and the extension is hidden, or the library is only imported with a prefix. In other words, if the extension had been a class, it is only in scope if using the name would denote the class&mdash; which will allow you to call static methods on the class, which is exactly what we are going to do.

### Extension Member Resolution

The declaration introduces an extension. The extension's `on` type defines which types are being extended.

For any member access, `x.foo`, `x.bar()`, `x.baz = 42`, `x(42)`, `x[0] = 1` or `x + y`, including null-aware and cascade accesses which effectively desugar to one of those direct accesses, and including implicit member accesses on `this`, the language first checks whether the static type of `x` has a member with the same base name as the operation. That is, if it has a corresponding instance member, respectively, a `foo` method or getter or a `foo=` setter. a `bar` member or `bar=` setter, a `baz` member or `baz=` setter, a `call` method, a `[]=` operator or a `+` operator. If so, then the operation is unaffected by extensions. *This check does not care whether the invocation is otherwise correct, based on number or type of the arguments, it only checks whether there is a member at all.*

(The types `dynamic` and `Never` are considered as having all members, the type `void` is always a compile-time error when used in a receiver position, so none of these can ever be affected by static extension methods. Methods declared on `Object` are available on all types and therefore cannot be affected by extensions).

If there is no such member, the operation is currently a compile-time error. In that case, all extensions in scope are checked for whether they apply. An extension applies to a member access if the static type of the receiver is a subtype of the `on` type of the extension *and* the extension has an instance member with the same base name as the operation. 

For generic extensions, standard type inference is used to infer the type arguments. As an example, take the following extension:

```dart
extension MyList<T extends Comparable<T>> on List<T> {
  void quickSort() { ... }
}
```

and a member access like:

```dart
List<Duration> times = ...;
times.quickSort();
```

Here we perform type inference equivalent to what we would do for:

```dart
class MyList<T extends Comparable<T>> {
  MyList(List<T> argument);
  void quickSort() { ... }
}
...
List<Duration> times = ...;
... MyList(times).quickSort() ... // Infer type argument of MyList here.
```

This is inference based on static types only. The inferred type argument becomes the value of `T` for the function invocation that follows. Notice that the context type of the invocation does not affect whether the extension applies, and neither the context type nor the method invocation affects the type inference, but if the extension method itself is generic, the context type may affect the member invocation.

If the inference fails, or if the synthetic constructor invocation (`MyList(times)` in the above example) would not be statically valid for any other reason, then the extension does not apply. If an extension does not have an instance member with the base name `quickSort`, it does not apply.

If exactly one extension applies to an otherwise failed member invocation, then that invocation becomes an invocation of the corresponding instance member of the extension, with `this` bound to the receiver object and extension type parameters bound to the inferred types.

If the member is itself generic and has no type parameters supplied, normal static type inference applies again.

It is *as if* the invocation `times.quickSort` was converted to `MyList<Duration>(times).quickSort()`. The difference is that there is never an actual `MyList` object, and the `this` object inside `quickSort` is just the `times` list itself (although the extension methods apply to that code too).

### Extension Conflict Resolution

If more than one extension applies to a specific member invocation, then we resort to a heuristic to choose one of the extensions to apply. If exactly one of them is "more specific" than all the others, that one is chosen. Otherwise it is a compile-time error.

An extension with `on` type clause *T*<sub>1</sub> is more specific than another extension with `on` type clause *T*<sub>2</sub> iff the instantiated type (the type after applying type inference from the receiver) of *T*<sub>1</sub> is a subtype of the instantiated type of *T*<sub>2</sub> and either:

- not vice versa, or
- the instantiate-to-bounds type of *T*<sub>1</sub> is a subtype of the instantiate-to-bounds type of *T*<sub>2</sub> and not vice versa.

This definition is designed to ensure that the extension chosen is the one that has the most precise type information available.

If an extension's `on` type has a trailing `?`, say `T?`, then we treat it just as we would for the corresponding nullable type with NNBD types, which are described in a separate design document. In short, it means treating the type `T?`, for subtyping purposes, as a union type of `T` with `Null` (a least supertype of `T` and `Null`).

That is, the specificity of an extension wrt. an application depends of the type it is used at, and how specific the extension is itself (what its implementation can assume about the type). 

Example:

```dart
extension SmartIterable<T> on Iterable<T> {
  void doTheSmartThing(void Function(T) smart) {
    for (var e in this) smart(e);
  }
}
extension SmartList<T> on List<T> {
  void doTheSmartThing(void Function(T) smart) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) smart(this[i]);
  }
}
...
  List<int> x = ....;
  x.doTheSmartThing(print);
```

Here both the extensions apply, but the `SmartList` extension is more specific than the `SmartIterable` extension because `List<dynamic>` &lt;: `Iterable<dynamic>`.

Example:

```dart
extension BestCom<T extends num> on Iterable<T> { T best() {...} }
extension BestList<T> on List<T> { T best() {...} }
extension BestSpec on List<num> { num best() {...} }
...
  List<int> x = ...;
  var v = x.best();
  List<num> y = ...;
  var w = y.best();
```

Here all three extensions apply to both invocations.

For `x.best()`, the most specific one is `BestList`. Because `List<int>` is a proper subtype of both ` iterable<int>` and `<List<num>`, we expect `BestList` to be the best implementation. The return type causes `v` to have type `int`. If we had chosen `BestSpec` instead, the return type could only be `num`, which is one of the reasons why we choose the most specific instantiated type as the winner. 

For `y.best()`, the most specific extension is `BestSpec`. The instantiated `on` types that are compared are `Iterable<num>` for `Best
Com` and `List<num>` for the two other. Using the instantiate-to-bounds types as tie-breaker, we find that `List<Object>` is less precise than `List<num>`, so the code of `BestSpec` has more precise information available for its method implementation. The type of `w` becomes `num`.

In practice, unintended extension method name conflicts are likely to be rare. Intended conflicts happen where the same author is providing more specialized versions of an extension for subtypes, and in that case, picking the extension which has the most precise types available to it is considered the best choice.

### Overriding Access

If two or more extensions apply to the same member access, or if a member of the receiver type takes precedence over an extension method, or if the extension is imported with a prefix, then it is possible to force an extension member invocation:

```dart
MyList(object).quickSort();
```

or if you don't want the type argument to the extension to be inferred:

```dart
MyList<String>(object).quickSort();
```

or if you imported the extension with a prefix to avoid name collision:

```dart
prefix.MyList<String>(object).quickSort();
```

The syntax looks like a constructor invocation, but it does not create a new object.

If `object.quickSort()` would invoke an extension method of `MyList`, then `MyList(object).quickSort()` will invoke the exact same method in the same way.

The syntax is not *convenient*&mdash;you have to put the "constructor" invocation up front, which removes the one advantage that extension methods have over normal static methods. It is not intended as the common use-case, but as an escape hatch out of conflicts.

### Static Members and Member Resolution

Static member declarations in the extension declaration can be accessed the same way as static members of a class or mixin declaration: By prefixing with the extension's name.

Example:

```dart
extension MySmart on Object {
  smart() => smartHelper(this);  // valid
  static smartHelper(Object o) { ... }
}
...
  MySmart.smartHelper(someObject);  // valid
```

Like for a class or mixin declaration, static members simply treat the surrounding declaration as a namespace.

### Semantics of Invocations

If an extension is found to be the one applying to a member invocation, then at run-time, the invocation will perform a method invocation of the corresponding instance member of the extension, with `this` bound to the receiver value and type parameters bound to the types found by static inference.

If the receiver is `null`, then that invocation is an immediate run-time error unless the `on` type of the extension has a trailing `?`.

With NNBD types, a non-nullable `on` type would not match a nullable receiver type, so it is impossible to invoke an extension method that does not expect `null` on a `null` value (except with legacy unsafely nullable types, then it's still a run-time error if the `on` type is not nullable)

In a fully migrated NNBD mode program, an extension with a non-nullable `on` type does not apply to a receiver with a nullable type, and a nullable `on` type means that the `this` value may be `null` inside the extension methods.

During NNBD migration, where non-nullable type may contain `null`, it stays a run-time error if an extension method is called on `null` and a migrated extension's `on` type does not allow null, or an unmigrated extension does not have a trailing `?` on the `on` type. 

During NNBD migration, we will have unsound nullable types like `int*` which should be matched by `extension Wot on int {…}` (in migrated code), and in that case we will need a run-time check to avoid passing `null` to that extension. Unmigrated extensions will still need the trailing `?` to allow getting called with `null` as receiver, but they will apply to nullable types everywhere.

### Semantics of Extension Members

When executing an extension instance member, we stated earlier that the member is invoked with the original receiver as `this` object. We still have to describe how that works, and what the lexical scope is for those members.

Inside an extension method body, `this` is bound to the original receiver, and the static type of `this` is the `on` type (which may contain type variables as usual).

Invocations on `this` use the same extension method resolution as any other code. Most likely  the current extension will be the only one in scope which applies.

Like for a class or mixin member declaration, the names of the extension members, both static and instance, are in the *lexical* scope of the extension member body. That is why `MySmart` above can invoke the static `smartHelper` without prefixing it by the extension name. In the same way, *instance* member declarations (the extension members) are in the lexical scope. 

If an unqualified identifier may lexically resolve to an extension method, the invocation becomes an explicit invocation of that extension method on `this` (which we already know has a compatible type for the extension).

Example:

```dart
extension MyUnaryNumber on List<Object> {
  bool get isEven => length.isEven;
  bool get isOdd => !isEven;
  static bool isListEven(List<Object> list) => list.isEven;
}
```

Here the `list.isEven` will find that `isEven` of `MyUnaryNumber` applies, and unless there are any other extensions in scope, it will call that. (Or unless someone adds an `isEven` member to `List`, but that's a breaking change, and then, if still necessary, this code can change the call to `MyUnaryNumber(list).isEven`.)

The unqualified `length` of `isEven` is not defined in the current lexical scope, so is equivalent to  `this.length`, which is valid since `List<Object>` has a `length` getter.

The unqualified `isEven` of `isOdd` resolves lexically to the `isEvent` getter above it, so it is equivalent to `MyUnaryNumber(this).isEven`,  even if there are other extensions in scope which define an `isEven` on `List<Object>`.

Even though you can access `this`, you cannot use `super` inside an extension method.

### Member Conflict Resolution

An extension can declare a member with the same (base-)name as a member of the type it is declared on. This does not cause a compile-time conflict, even if the member does not have a compatible signature.

Example:

```dart
extension MyList<T> on List<T> {
  void add(T value, {int count = 1}) { ... }
  void add2(T value1, T value2) { ... }
}
```

You cannot *access* this member in a normal invocation, so it could be argued that you shouldn't be allowed to add it. We allow it because we do not want to make it a compile-time error to add an instance member to an existing class just because an extension is already adding a method with the same name. It will likely be a problem if any code *uses* the method, but only that code needs to change (perhaps using an override to keep using the extension).

An unqualified identifier can refer to any extension member declaration of the extension, so inside an extension member body, `this.add` and `add` are not necessarily the same thing (if the `on` type has an `add` member, then `this.add` refers to that, while `add` refers to the extension method in the lexical scope). This may be confusing. In practice, extensions will rarely introduce members with the same name as their `on` type's members.

### Tearoffs

A static extension method can be torn off like any other instance method.

```dart
extension Foo on Bar {
  int baz<T>(T x) => x.toString().length;
}
...
  Bar b = ...;
  int Function(int) func = b.baz;
```

This assignment does a tear-off of the `baz` method. In this case it even does generic specialization, so it creates a function value of type `int Function(int)` which, when called with argument `x`, works just as `Foo(b).baz<int>(x)`, whether or not`Foo` is in scope at the point where the function is called. The torn off function closes over both the extension type and the receiver, and over any type arguments that it is implicitly instantiated with.

An explicitly overridden extension method, like `Foo<Bar>(b).baz` also works as a tear-off. 

There is still no way to tear off getters, setters or operators. If we ever introduce such a feature, it should work for extension methods too.

## Summary

- Extensions are declared using the syntax:

  ```ebnf
  <extension> ::= `extension' <identifier>? <typeParameters>? `on' <type> `?'?
     `{'
       <memberDeclaration>*
     `}'
  ```

  where `extension` becomes a built-in identifier and `<memberDeclaration>` does not allow instance variables, constructors or abstract members. It does allow static members.

- The extension declaration introduces a name (`<identifier>`) into the surrounding scope. 

  - The name can be shown or hidden in imports/export. It can be shadowed by other declarations as any other top-level declaration.
  - The name can be used as prefix for invoking static members (used as a namespace, same as class/mixin declarations).

- A member invocation (getter/setter/method/operator) which targets a member that is not on the static type of the receiver (no member with same base-name is available) is subject to extension application.  It would otherwise be a compile-time error.

- An extension applies to such a member invocation if 

  - the extension name is visible in the lexical scope,
  - the extension declares an instance member with the same base name, and 
  - the `on` type (after type inference) of the extension is a super-type of the static type of the receiver.

- Type inference for `extension Foo<T> on Bar<T> { baz<S>(params) => ...}` for an invocation `receiver.baz(args)` is performed as if the extension was a class:

  ```dart
  class Foo<T> {
    Bar<T> _receiver;
    Foo(Bar<T> this._receiver);
    void baz<S>(params) => ...;
  }
  ```

  that was invoked as `Foo(receiver).baz(args)`. The binding of `T` and `S` found here is the same binding used by the extension.  If the constructor invocation would be a compile-time error, the extension does not apply.

- One extension is more specific than another if the instantiated `on` type of the former is a proper subtype of the instantiated `on` type of the latter, or if the two instantiated types are equivalent and the instantiate-to-bounds `on` type of the former is a proper subtype of the one on the latter.  An `on` type `T?`, with a trailing `?` works like a NNBD nullable type.

- If there is no single most-specific extension which applies to a member invocation, then it is a compile-time error. (This includes the case with no applicable extensions, which is just the current behavior).

- Otherwise, the single most-specific extension's member is invoked with the extension's type parameters bound to the types found by inference, and with `this ` bound to the receiver.

- An extension method can be invoked explicitly using the syntax `ExtensionName(object).method(args)`. Type arguments can be applied to the extension explicitly as well, `MyList<String>(listOfString).quickSort()`. Such an invocation overrides all extension resolution. It is a compile-time error if `ExtensionName` would not apply to the `object.method(args)` invocation if it was in scope. 

- The override can also be used for extensions imported with a prefix (which are not otherwise in scope): `prefix.ExtensionName(object).method(args)`.

- An invocation of an extension method throws if the receiver is `null` unless the `on` type has a trailing `?`. With NNBD types, the invocation throws if the receiver is `null` and the instantiated `on` type of the selected extension does not accept `null`. (In most cases, this case can be excluded statically, but not for unsafely nullable types like `int*`).

- Otherwise an invocation of an extension method runs the instance method with `this` bound to the receiver and with type variables bound to the types found by type inference (or written explicitly for an override invocation). The static type of `this` is the `on` type of the extension.

- Inside an instance extension member, extension members accessed by unqualified name are treated as extension override accesses on `this`. Otherwise invocations on `this` are treated as any other invocations on the same static type.

## Variants

The design above can be extended in the following ways.

### Multiple `on` Types

The `on <type>` clause only allows a single type. The similar clause on `mixin` declarations allow multiple types, as long as they can all agree on a single combined interface. 

We could allow multiple types in the `extension` `on` clause as well. It would have the following consequences:

- An extension only applies if the receiver type is a subtype of *all* `on` types.
- An extension is more specific than another if for every `on` type in the latter, there is an `on` type in the former which is a proper subtype of that type, or the two are equivalent, and the former is a proper subtype of the latter when instantiated to bounds.
- The trailing `?` makes the most sense if it is applied only once (it's the extension which accepts and understands `null` as a receiver), but for forwards compatibility, we will need to put it on every `on` type individually. All `on` types must be nullable in order to accept a nullable receiver.
- There is no clear type to assign to `this` inside an instance extension method. For a mixin that's not a problem because it introduces a type by itself, and the combined super-interface is only used for `super` invocations. For extension, a statement like `var self = this;` needs to be assigned a useful type.

The last item is the reason this feature is not something we will definitely do. We can start out without the feature and maybe add it later if it is necessary, but it's safer to start without it.

### Extending Static Members

The feature above only extends instance members. There is no way to add a new static member on an existing type, something that should logically be a *simpler* operation.

We could allow

```dart
extension MyInt on num {
  int get double => this * s;
  static int get random => 4;
}
```

to introduce both a `double` instance getter on `num` instances and a `random` getter on `num` itself, usable as `var n = num.random;`

However, while this is possible, not all `on` types are class or mixin types. It is not clear what it would mean to put static methods on `on` types of extension like:

- `extension X on Iterable<int>`
- `extension X<T extends Comparable<T>> on Iterable<T>`
- `extension X on int Function(int)`
- `extension X on FutureOr<int>`
- `extension X on int?`

For the first two, we could put the static members on the `Iterable` class, but since the extension does not apply to *all* iterables, it is not clear that this is correct.

For `int Function(int)` and `FutureOr<int>`, it's unclear how to call such a static method at all. We can denote`int Function(int)` with a type alias, but putting static members on type aliases is a new concept.  We could put the static method on `Function`, but that's not particularly discoverable, and why not require that they are put on `Functon` explicitly. For `FutureOr`, we could allow static members on `FutureOr` (which is a denotable type), but again it seems spurious. For `int?`, we could put the method on `int`, but why not  just require that it's on `int`.

The issue here is that the type patterns used by `on` are much more powerful than what is necessary to put static members on class types.

It would probably be more readable to introduce a proper static extension declaration:

```dart
static extension Foo on int {  // or: extension Foo on static int 
  int fromList(List l) => l.length;
}

...
  print(int.fromList([1, 2])); // 2
```

where the `on` type must be something that can already have static methods. 

The disadvantage is that if you want to introduce related functionality that is both static and instance methods on a class, then you need to write two extensions with different names.

If we allow extension static declarations like these, we can also allow extension constructors.

### Explicitly Specify Related Declarations

The conflict resolution described above is heuristic. It chooses a winner among potential extensions based entirely on the `on` type.

If the applicable extensions are deliberately written to co-exist, with some extensions using more efficient algorithms on more precisely know receivers, then that conflict resolution algorithm gives the extension authors a clean and, hopefully, understandable way to control which extension is chosen in which situation. A more precise algorithm will be chosen over a less precise one (say, an operation on `List<int>` over one on`Iterable<int>`).

However, if the applicable extensions are unrelated, written by authors which are oblivious to the other extensions, then the choice risks being arbitrary. A small change, say from `extension Foo on num` to `extension Foo<T extends num> on T`, which will not change where the extension applies, will change the specificity ordering. That makes the conflict resolution heuristic *fragile*.

There is no way for an author to express the intent that one extension is a specialization of another, and that another one isn't. The only author intent available is in which extensions are imported in the library which triggers the extension member. However, anyone can add an extension to an existing library, or change the specificity of an extension (generalizing an extension with `on` type of `int`  to work on all `num`s), which should be non-breaking changes, but which affects conflict resolution.

Alternatively, we can allow extensions to declare that they are *related*, and only allow conflicts between related extensions, which are presumably aware of each other. Then a conflict between any two unrelated extensions is a compile-time error and will require an explicit override, which will also be stable against future changes.

The syntax would be:

```dart
extension Foo<T> on Iterable<T> { twizzle() {...} fromp() { ... }}
extension Bar<T> extends Foo<T> on List<T> { twizzle() { ... } } 
```

If both of these extensions apply, then pick the one that extends the other. If there are more related extensions which apply, then pick one which transitively extends all the others.

It should probably be possible to declare that an extension `extends` more than one other extension. That allows an extension hierarchy which matches a diamond type pattern. If you can only extend a single extension, only tree-shaped type hierarchies can be matched by the extensions.

If there isn't exactly one among applicable extensions which extends all the rest, the conflict is a compile-time error.

This approach allows related extensions to declare functionality on a number of types, without accidentally allowing a conflict with an unrelated extension. There is no heuristic in the conflict resolution, the choice is made entirely based on existing information added explicitly to make that choice. At least one author has made the explicit choice of declaring that if all the currently applicable extensions are available, their extension should be used.

This should be sufficient to avoid arbitrary extensions from applying.

On top of that, we *may* want to require that the extending extension is defined `on` a subtype of its super-extension. In the above, the `on` type of `Bar<T>` is `List<T>`, which is a subtype of the `on` type of `Foo<T>`, which is `Iterable<T>`. This is not strictly required, and an extending extension could also be allowed to be declared on a supertype of the extended extension (an unrelated type would mean that the `extends` is likely unnecessary). The only reason to make the restriction is that this feature is intended for *specialization*, not wholesale replacement. Even if we do this, the subtype does not have to be a proper subtype, so it's still possible to completely shadow the extended extension.

Also, we may, and perhaps should, require that the declared extension methods in the extending extension must be valid overrides of the same-named super-extension's extension methods, as if it was a subclass relationship. This will ensure that a user who only knows about the super-extension will still get a consistent signature when they instead hit the extending extension.

If we do require the extending extension's `on` type to be a subtype of the extended extension's `on` type, then we can also let the extending extension *inherit* any member that it doesn't specialize. This will not work if there is more than one super-extension declaring the same member. It's unclear whether this has any advantage.

### Explicitly Specify Related Declarations 2

Alternative syntax: Allow extensions with the same *name* to be related:

```dart
extension Foo<T> on Iterable<T> { twizzle() { ... } }
extension Foo<T> on List<T> { twizzle() { ... } }
```

Whenever an extension is declared with the same name as another extension in scope, it is considered as being *related*, which is an equivalence relation. The declaration extends the extension rather than conflicting with it. 

Only extension resolution conflicts between related extensions are allowed and resolved, any other conflict between applicable extensions is a compile-time error. We then still need to use an ordering relation on the `on` type to figure out which one is more specific in a particular case, and it can fail if there isn't one most specific applicable extension.

An explicit override like `Foo(something).twizzle()` would still have to pick the most specific applicable extension. There is no way to hide one part of an extension "cluster", and no way to override with a specific extension declaration since they all have the same name. If the extensions do not have the same number of type parameters, an explicit instantiated override like `Foo<int>(something)` won't apply to all of them, which may be confusing.

Maybe even allow combined declarations when the extensions do have the same type parameters:

```dart
extension Foo<T> 
  on Iterable<T> { twizzle() { ... } }
  on List<T> { twizzle() { ... } }
```

This shows that it really is a single thing being declared, even if we allow multiple declarations with the same name. (We can also choose not to allow multiple declarations, and require all related extensions to be declared in a single declaration with multiple `on` clauses like above).

This approach works *badly* with static members.

### Aliasing

If we have two different extensions with the same name, they can't both be in scope, even if they don't apply to the same types. At least one of them must be delegated to a prefixed import scope, and if so, it doesn't *work* as an extension method any more.

To overcome this issue, we can use a *generalized typedef* to give a new name to an existing entity in a given scope. Example:

```dart
typedef MyCleverList<T> = prefix.MyList<T>;
```

If `prefix.MyList` is an extension, this would put that extension back in the current scope under a different name (use a private name to avoid exporting the extension again).

If we do this, we should be *consistent* with other type aliases, which means that the type parameter of the RHS must be explicit. Just writing

```drt
typedef MyCleverList = prefix.MyList; // bad!
```

would make `MyCleverList` an alias for `prefix.MyList<dynamic>`, which would still apply to `List<anything>`, but the type variable of `MyList` will always be `dynamic`. Similarly, we can put more bounds on the type variable:

```dart
typedef MyWidgetList<T extends Widget> = prefix.MyList<T>;
```

Here the extension will only apply if it matches `Widget` *and* would otherwise match `MyList` (but `T` needs to be a valid type argument to `MyList`, which means that it must satisfy all bounds of `MyList` as well, otherwise the typedef is rejected).

The use of `typedef` for something which is not a type may be too confusing. Another option is:

```dart
extension MyWidgetList<T extends Widget> = prefix.MyList<T>;
```

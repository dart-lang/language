# Dart Enhanced Enum Classes

Author: lrn@google.com<br>Version: 1.8<br>Tracking issue [#158](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/158)

This is a formal specification for a language feature which allows `enum` declarations to declare classes with fields, methods and `const` constructors initializing those fields. Further, `enum` declarations can implement interfaces and apply mixins.

## Grammar

Without the enhanced enums feature specified in this document, enum declarations are restricted to:

```dart
enum Name {
  id1, id2, id3
}
```

That is: `enum`, a single identifier for the name, and a block containing a comma separated list of identifiers.

With the enhanced enums feature, a declaration like the following is also allowed:

```dart
enum Name<T extends Object?> with Mixin1, Mixin2 implements Interface1, Interface2 {
  id1<int>(args1), id2<String>(args2), id3<bool>(args3);
  memberDeclaration*
  const Name(params) : initList;
}
```

where `memberDeclaration*` is almost any sequence of static and instance member declarations, or constructors, with some necessary restrictions specified below.

The `;` after the value list is optional if there is nothing else in the declaration (for backwards compatibility), and required if there is any member declaration after it. The value list may have a trailing comma in either case (like now).

The superclass of the mixin applications is the `Enum` class (which has a concrete `index` getter and otherwise only the members of `Object`, so the only valid `super` invocations on that superclass are those valid on `Object` and `super.index`).

The grammar of the `enum` declaration becomes:

```ebnf
<enumType> ::=
  `enum' <identifier> <typeParameters>? <mixins>? <interfaces>? `{'
     <enumEntry> (`,' <enumEntry>)* (`,')? (`;'
     (<metadata> <classMemberDefinition>)*
     )?
  `}'

<enumEntry> ::= <metadata> <identifier> <argumentPart>?
  | <metadata> <identifier> <typeArguments>? `.' <identifier> <arguments>
```

It is a **compile-time error** if the enum declaration contains any generative constructor which is not `const`.

_We_ could _allow omitting the `const` on constructors, since it’s required, so we could just assume it’s always there. That’s a convenience we can also add at any later point. For now we require the `const`._

It is a **compile-time error** if the initializer list of a non-redirecting generative constructor includes a `super` constructor invocation.

_We will introduce the necessary super-invocation ourselves as an implementation detail. From the user’s perspective, they extend `Enum` which has no public constructors. We could allow `super()`, which would then be a constructor of `Enum`, but it's simpler to just disallow super invocations entirely._

It is a **compile-time error** if the argument list of a non-redirecting generative constructor includes a `super` parameter.

_Super parameters (a feature introduced in the same release as enhanced enums) implicitly adds arguments to the `super` constructor invocation of a non-redirecting generative constructor, and such enum constructors do not have a known superclass constructor expecting such arguments._

It is a **compile-time error** to refer to a declared or default generative constructor of an `enum` declaration in any way, other than:

* As the target of a redirecting generative constructor of the same `enum` declaration (`: this(...);`/`: this.targetName(...);`), or
* Implicitly in the enum value declarations of the same `enum` (`enumValueName(args)`/`enumValueName.targetName(args)`).

_No-one is allowed to invoke a generative constructor and create an instance of the `enum` other than the enumerated enum values. 
That also means that a redirecting *factory* constructor cannot redirect to a generative constructor of an `enum`,
and therefore no factory constructor of an `enum` declaration can be `const`, because a `const` factory constructor must redirect to a generative constructor._

It's a **compile-time error** if the enum declaration contains a static or instance member declaration with the name `values`, or if the superclass or any superinterface of the enum declaration has an interface member named `values`. _A `values` static constant member will be provided for the class, this restriction ensures that there is no conflict with that declaration._

## Semantics

The `Enum` class from the `dart:core` library behaves as if it was declared as:

```dart
class Enum {
  // No default constructor.
  external int get index;
  external String toString();
}
```

We intend to (at least pretend to) let `enum` classes extend `Enum`, and let mixins and members access the default `index` and `toString()` through `super.`. _(In practice, we may use a different class implementing `Enum` as the superclass, but for checking the validity of `super.index`/`super.toString()`, we analyze against `Enum` itself, so it must have concrete implementations.)_

This all makes it look as if `Enum` would be a valid superclass for the mixin applications and methods of the enhanced `enum` class.

The semantics of such an enum declaration, *E* with name *N*, is defined as introducing a (semantic) *class*, *C*, just like a similar `class` declaration.

* **Name**: The name of the class *C* and its implicit interface is the name *N* of the `enum` declaration.

* **Superclass**: The superclass of *C* is an implementation-specific built-in class *`EnumImpl`*, with the mixins declared by *E* applied. _(The `EnumImpl` class may be the `Enum` class itself or it may be another class which extends or implements `Enum`, but as seen from a non-platform library the interface of *`EnumImpl`* is the same as that of `Enum`, and its methods work as specified for `Enum` )_

  * If *E* is declared as <code>enum *N* with *Mixin1*, *Mixin2* …</code> then the superclass of *C* is the mixin application <Code>*EnumImpl* with *Mixin1*, *Mixin2*</code>.

  It’s a **compile-time error** if such a mixin application introduces any instance variables. _We need to be able to call an implementation specific superclass `const` constructor of `Enum`, and a mixin application of a mixin with a field does not make its forwarding constructor `const`. Currently that’s the only restriction, but if we add further restrictions on mixin applications having `const` forwarding constructors, those should also apply here._

* **Superinterfaces**: The immediate superinterfaces of *C* are the interface of the superclass and the interfaces declared by `implements` in *E*.

  * If `E` is declared as `enum Name with Mixin1, Mixin2 implements Type1, Type2 { … }` then the immediate superinterfaces of *C* are the interfaces of `Name with Mixin1, Mixin2`, `Type1` and `Type2`.

- **Declared members**: For each member declaration of the `enum` declaration *E*, the same member is added to the class *C*. This includes constructors (which must be `const` generative or non-`const` factory constructors.)

- **Default constructor**: If no generative constructors were declared, and also no factory constructor with name *N* was declared,
  a default generative constructor is added:

  ```dart
  const Name();
  ```

  _(This differs from the default constructor of a normal `class` declaration by being constant, and by being added even if a factory constructor is present. If no generative constructor is declared, and the unnamed constructor name is taken by a factory constructor, there is no way for the enum declaration to compile successfully, since the declaration must contain at least one enum value, and that enum value must refer to a generative constructor.)_

- **Enum values**: For each `<enumEntry>` with name *id* and index *i* in the comma-separated list of enum entries, a constant value is created, and a static constant variable named *id* is created in *C* with that value. All the constant values are associated, in some implementation dependent way, with 

  - their name *id* as a string `"id"`, 
  - their index *i* as an `int`, and
  - their `enum` class’s name as a string, <code>"*N*"</code>,

  all of which are accessible to the `toString` and `index` member of `Enum`, and to the `EnumName.name` extension getter. The values are computed as by the following constant constructor invocations.

  - <code>*id*</code> &mapsto; <code>const *N*()</code> (no arguments, equivalent to empty argument list)
  - <code>*id*(*args*)</code> &mapsto; <code>const *N*(*args*)</code>
  - <code>*id*<*types*>(*args*)</code> &mapsto; <code>const *N*<*types*>(*args*)</code>
  - <code>*id*.*named*(*args*)</code> &mapsto; <Code>const *N*.*named*(*args*)</code>
  - <code>*id*<*types*>.*named*(*args*)</code> &mapsto; <code>const *N*<*types*>.*named*(*args*)</code>

  where *args* are considered as occurring in a `const` context, and it’s a **compile-time error** if they are then not compile-time constants.

The resulting constructor invocations are subject to type inference, using the empty context type. *This implies that inferred type arguments to the constructor invocation itself may depend on the types of the argument expressions of `args`.* The type of the constant variable is the static type of the resulting constant object creation expression.

The objects created here are *not canonicalized* like other constant object creations. _(In practice, the index value is considered part of the object, so no two objects will have the same state.)_

- **Static `values` list**: A static constant variable named `values` is added as by the declaration <code>static const List<*N*> values = [*id*<sub>1</sub>, …, *id*<sub>*n*</sub>];</code>
  where <code>*id*<sub>1<sub></code>…<code>*id*<sub>*n*</sub></code> are the names of the enum entries of the `enum` declaration in source/index order.
  _If *C* is a generic class (*E* is a generic enum), the <code>List<N></code> instantiates <code>*N*</code> to its bounds._

It's a **compile-time error** if an `enum` declaration declares or inherits a concrete member named `index` which overrides the `index` getter of the `Enum` class. _Such an inherited `index` member would necessarily have been introduced by a mixin application of the `enum` declaration._

It's a **compile-time error** if an `enum` declaration declares or inherits a concrete member named `hashCode` or `==` *(an `operator ==` declaration)* which overrides the `hashCode` getter or `==` operator of the `Object` class. (The `Enum` class does not override `hashCode` or `operator==` from `Object`). _This ensures that enum values can be used as switch statement case values, which is the main advantage of using an enum over just writing a normal class._

If the resulting class would have any naming conflicts, or other compile-time errors, the `enum` declaration is invalid and a compile-time error occurs. Such errors include, but are not limited to:

- Declaring or inheriting (from `Enum` or from a declared mixin or interface) any member with the same basename as an enum value which is not a static setter. _(The introduced static declarations would have a conflict.)_
- Declaring or mixing in a member which is not a valid override of a super-interface member declaration, including the `runtimeType`,  `noSuchMethod` and `toString` members of `Object`, or any members introduced by mixin applications.
- Declaring or inheriting an member signature with no corresponding implementation. _(For example declaring an abstract `String toString([int optional])`, but not providing an implementation.)_
- Declaring a generic `enum` which does not have a valid well-bounded instantiate-to-bounds result. _(The automatically introduced <code>static const List<*N*> values</code> requires a well-bounded instantiate-to-bounds result)_.
- Declaring a generic `enum` which does not have a regular-bounded instantiate-to-bounds result *and* that has an enum value declaration omitting the type arguments and not having arguments from which type arguments can be inferred. _(For example `enum EnumName<F extends C<F>> { foo; }` would introduce an implicit `static const foo = EnumName(0, "foo");` declaration where the constructor invocation requires a regular-bounded instantiate-to-bounds result)_.
- Using a non-constant expression as an argument of an enum value declaration.
- Declaring a static member and inheriting an instance member with the same base-name.

If not invalid, the semantics denoted by the `enum` declaration is that class, which we’ll refer to as the *corresponding class* of the `enum` declaration. *(We don’t require the implementation to be exactly such a class declaration, there might be other helper classes involved in the implementation, and different private members, but the publicly visible interface and behavior should match.)*

That is, if the corresponding class of an `enum` declaration is valid, the `enum` declaration introduces the *public interface* and *type* of the corresponding class. _There are, however, restrictions on how that class and interface can be used, listed in the next section._

### Implementing `Enum` and enum types

It’s currently a compile-time error for a class to implement, extend or mix-in the `Enum` class.

Because we want to allow interfaces and mixins that are intended to be applied to `enum` declarations, and therefore to assume `Enum` to be a superclass, we loosen that restriction to:

- It's a **compile-time error** if a *concrete* class has `Enum` as a superinterface (directly or transitively) unless it is the corresponding class of an `enum` declaration. _(Abstract interfaces and mixins implementing `Enum` are allowed, but only so that they can be used by `enum` declarations, they can never be used to create an instance which implements `Enum`, but which is not an enum value.)_
- It is a **compile-time error** if a class implements, extends or mixes-in the class or interface introduced by an `enum` declaration. _(An enum class can’t be used as a mixin since it is not a `mixin` declaration and the class has a superclass other than `Object`, but we include “mixes-in” for completeness.)_
- It's a **compile-time error** if a `class` or `mixin` declaration has `Enum` as a superinterface and the interface of the declarations contains an instance member with the name `values`, whether declared or inherited. _If any concrete class implements this interface, it will be an `enum` declaration class, and then the `values` member would conflict with the static `values` constant getter that is automatically added to `enum` declaration classes. Such an instance `values` declaration is either useless or wrong, so we disallow it entirely._
- It's a **compile-time error** if a `class` or `mixin` declaration has `Enum` as a superinterface, and that class or mixin declares or inherits a concrete instance member named `index`, `hashCode` or `==` *(an `operator ==` declaration)*. _That `index` member could override the `index` getter inherited from `Enum`, and we currently do not allow that. The `hashCode` and `operator==` declarations would prevent the enum class from having "primitive equality", and we want to ensure that enums can be used in switches._

Those restrictions allow abstract classes (interfaces) which *implement* `Enum` in order to have the `int index;` getter member available, and also allow `mixin` declarations to use `Enum` as an `on` type because `mixin` declarations cannot be instantiated directly.

_The restrictions still ensure that `enum` values are the only objects whose run-time type implements `Enum`, while making it valid to declare `abstract class MyInterface implements Enum` and `mixin MyMixin on Enum` for interfaces and mixins intended to be used in `enum` declarations. It's also impossible to override the instance getters `index` and `hashCode`, or the operator `==`, and impossible to interfere with the static  `values` getter, without causing a compile-time error. For example, if an enum declaration implements an interface containing the signature `Never get index;`, then because it's not possible to override `int get index;` from `Enum`, the resulting class will not implement its interface, and that is a compile-time error._

## Formatting

The recommended formatting of an `enum` declaration is to format the header (before the first `{`) just like a `class` declaration. Then, if the enum value declarations are all single identifiers, and there is no trailing comma, try to fit the identifiers (and any following semicolon) on one line. If any of the value declarations have arguments, if the values have a trailing comma, or if the identifiers do not fit on one line, put each value declaration on a new line. If there is no trailing comma, put any semicolon after the last entry. If there is a trailing comma, put any semicolon on the next line, by itself. Then, if there are member declarations, have an empty line before the member declarations, which are formatted just like they would be in a class declaration.

## Implementation

The specification here does not specify *how* the index and name of an enum is associated with the enum instances. In practice it’s possible to desugar an `enum` declaration to a `class` declaration, as long as the desugaring can access private names from other libraries (`dart:core` in particular).

The existing enums are implemented as desugaring into a class extending a private `_Enum` class which holds the `final int index;` declaration and a `final String _name;` declaration (used by the the `EnumName.name` getter), and both fields are initialized by a constructor. 

In practice, the implementation of the enhanced enums will likely be something similar.

Either first declare `Enum` as:

```dart
abstract class Enum {
  Enum._(this.index, this._name);  
  final int index;
  final String _name;
  String _$enumToString();
  String toString() => _$enumToString();
}
```

*or* retain the current `_Enum` class and make that the actual superclass of `enum` classes. Either works, I’ll use `Enum` as the superclass directly in the following.

Then desugar an `enum` declaration to an actual `class` declaration and rewrite every generative constructor of the `enum` declaration to take two extra leading positional arguments. 

The `enum` declaration:

```dart
enum LogPriority with LogPriorityMixin implements Comparable<LogPriority> {
  warning(2, "Warning"),
  error(1, "Error"),
  log.unknown("Log"),
  ;
 
  LogPriority(this.priority, this.prefix);
  LogPriority.unknown(String prefix) : this(-1, prefix);
    
  final String prefix;
  final int priorty;
  int compareTo(Log other) => priority - other.priority;
}
```

would then desugar to something like:

```dart
class LogPriority extends Enum with LogriorityMixin implements Comparable<LogPriority> {
  static const warning = LogPriority._$(0, "warning", 2, "Warning");
  static const error = LogPriority._$(1, "error", 1, "Error");
  static const log = LogPriority._$unknown(2, "log", "Log");
  
  LogPriority._$(int _$index, String _$name, this.priority, this.prefix) 
        : super(_$index, _$name);
  LogPriority._$unknown(int _$index, String _$name, String prefix) : 
        : this._$(_$index, _$name, -1, prefix);
    
  final String prefix;
  final int priorty;
  int compareTo(Log other) => priority - other.priority;
    
  static const List<LogPriority> values = [warning, error, log];
    
  // Refers to privates in dart:core.
  String _$enumToString() => "LogPriority.${_$name}";
}
```

where the `_$` represents a fresh name. 

In practice, we may choose to have a subclass of `Enum` as the actual superclass of the `enum` class, rather than use `Enum` directly. We’ll have to make sure that it makes no difference wrt. which declarations are valid (at least outside of `dart:core`, and for `enum`s declared inside `dart:core` it’s our own responsibility to not conflict with names used by the enum implementation.)

## Summary

We let `enum` declarations be much more like the classes they are, with the only restriction now being that it’s classes with a fixed number of known constant instances. We allow the class to apply mixins (applicable to a supertype of `Enum`) and implement interfaces. We allow any static or instance member declaration, and any generative `const` constructor declaration (so instance variables must be final, including those added by mixins, otherwise the mixin application constructor forwarders to the superclass `const Enum()` constructor won’t be `const`).

The enum values can call the declared constructors, or the default unnamed zero-argument `const` constructor which is added if no other constructor is declared. The syntax looks like a constructor invocation except that the enum value name replaces the class name. If no type arguments or value arguments are needed, and the constructor invoked is unnamed, the enum value can still be a plain identifier.

Enum instances are objects like any other object, and with this change they can implement interfaces and inherit members from mixins. The main difference between an `enum` declaration and a hand-written “equivalent class” using the enum pattern is that:

- The `enum` types implement `Enum`. The `Enum` type is otherwise sealed against instantiation, so no other *objects* than enum entries can implement it. Abstract classes and mixins can implement or extend `Enum`, but unless they are then implemented by or mixed into an `enum` declaration, no objects can actually implement the type of that class or mixin.
- The `enum` types themselves are completely sealed. No other class can implement an `enum` type.

- Because of that, `enum` types support exhaustiveness checking in `switch` cases in the language _(meaning that flow-control can see that an exhaustive switch over enum values cannot pass through without executing at least one `case`, which can then affect variable promotion)_.
- The `EnumName.name` extension member works on `enum` values.

If the *restrictions* are acceptable (the type is sealed; there is only a finite, statically known set of instances; the class  implements `Enum`; it cannot override `index`, `hashCode` or operator `==`; and it cannot have a user-written member named `values`), there should no longer be any reason to *not* make your enum-like class a language-based `enum`.

## Examples:

### Plain, existing syntax

```dart
enum Plain {
  foo, bar, baz
}
```

would have a corresponding class desugaring of:

```dart
class Plain extends Enum {  
  static const Plain foo = Plain._$(0, "foo");  
  static const Plain bar = Plain._$(1, "bar");  
  static const Plain baz = Plain._$(2, "baz");  
  static const List<Plain> values = [foo, bar, baz];  
  const Plain._$(int _$index, String_ $name) : super._(_$index, $_name);  
  
  // Private names from `dart:core`.  
  String _$enumToString() => "Plain.${_$name}";
}
```

### Simple but comparable

```dart
enum Ordering with EnumIndexOrdering<Ordering> {
  zero,
  few,
  many;
}

mixin EnumIndexOrdering<T extends Enum> on Enum implements Comparable<T> {
  int compareTo(T other) => this.index - other.index;
}
```

would have a  corresponding class desugaring of:

```dart
class Ordering extends Enum with EnumIndexOrdering<Ordering> {
  static const zero = Ordering._$(0, "zero");
  static const few = Ordering._$(1, "few");
  static const many = Ordering._$(2, "many");
  static const List<Ordering> values = [zero, few, many];
  
  // Default constructor desugared:
  Ordering._$(int _$index, String _$name): super(_$index, _$name);
  
  // Private names from `dart:core`.
  String _$enumToString() => "Ordering.${_$name}";
}
```

### Complex, one with everything

```dart
mixin EnumComparable<T extends Enum> on Enum implements Comparable<T> {
  int compareTo(T other) => this.index - other.index;
}

// With type parameter, mixin and interface.
enum Complex<T extends Pattern> with EnumComparable<Complex> implements Pattern {
  whitespace<RegExp>(r"\s+", RegExp.new),
  alphanum<RegExp>.captured(r"\w+", RegExp.new),
  anychar<Glob>("?", Glob.new),
  ;

  // Static variables. (Could use Expando, this is likely more efficient.)
  static final List<Pattern?> _patterns = List<Pattern?>.filled(3, null);

  // Final instance variables.
  final String _patternSource;
  final T Function(String) _factory;

  // Unnamed constructor. Non-redirecting.
  const Complex(String pattern, T Function(String) factory)
      : _patternSource = pattern, _factory = factory;

  // Factory constructor.
  factory Complex.matching(String text) {
    for (var value in values) {
      if (value.allMatches(text).isNotEmpty && value is Complex<T>) {
        return value;
      }
    }
    throw UnsupportedError("No pattern matching: $text");
  }

  // Named constructor. Redirecting.
  const Complex.captured(String regexpPattern, T Function(String) factory)
      : this("($regexpPattern)", factory);

  // Can expose the implicit name.
  String get name => EnumName(this).name;

  // Instance getter.
  Pattern get pattern => _patterns[this.index] ??= _factory(_patternSource);

  // Instance methods.
  Iterable<Match> allMatches(String input, [int start = 0]) =>
      pattern.allMatches(input, start);

  Match? matchAsPrefix(String input, [int start = 0]) =>
      pattern.matchAsPrefix(input, start);

  // Specifies `toString`.
  String toString() => "Complex<$T>($_patternSource)";
}
```

would have a corresponding class desugaring of:

```dart
class Complex<T extends Pattern> extends Enum with EnumComparable<Complex>
    implements Pattern {
  static const whitespace =
      Complex<RegExp>._$(0, "whitespace", r"\s+", RegExp.new);
  static const alphanum =
      Complex<RegExp>._$captured(1, "alphanum", r"\w+", RegExp.new);
  static const anychar = Complex<Glob>._$(2, "anychar", "?", Glob.new);
  static const List<Complex> values = [whitespace, alphanum, anychar];

  static final List<Pattern?> _patterns = List<Pattern?>.filled(3, null);

  final String _patternSource;
  final T Function(String) _factory;

  const Complex._$(int _$index, String _$name, String pattern, T Function(String) factory)
      : _patternSource = pattern, _factory = factory, super._(_$index, _$name);

  factory Complex.matching(String text) {
    for (var value in values) {
      if (value.allMatches(text).isNotEmpty && value is Complex<T>) {
        return value;
      }
    }
    throw UnsupportedError("No pattern matching: $text");
  }

  const Complex.captured(
      int _$index, String _$name, String regexpPattern, T Function(String) factory)
      : this(_$index, _$name, "($regexpPattern)", factory);

  String get name => EnumName(this).name;

  Pattern get pattern => _patterns[this.index] ??= _factory(_patternSource);

  Iterable<Match> allMatches(String input, [int start = 0]) =>
      pattern.allMatches(input, start);

  Match? matchAsPrefix(String input, [int start = 0]) =>
      pattern.matchAsPrefix(input, start);

  // Private names from `dart:core`.
  String _$enumToString() => "Complex.$_name";
    
  String toString() => "Complex<$T>($_patternSource)";
}
```

### Singleton

```dart
enum MySingleton implements Whatever {
  instance;

  const MySingleton(...) : ...;
  // Normal class declarations.
}
```

would have a corresponding class desugaring of:

```dart
class MySingleton extends Enum implements Whatever {
  static const MySingleton instance = MySingleton._$(0, "instance");
  static const List<MySingleton> values = [instance];
  const MySingleton._$(int _$index, String _$name, ...) : ..., super._(_$index, _$name);
  // Normal class declarations.
  
  // Private names from `dart:core`.
  String _$enumToString() => "MySingleton.${_$name}";
}
```

There is a chance that people will start using `enum` declarations to declare singleton classes. It has a little overhead, but it’s finite (and the `values` getter can likely be tree-shaken).

## Versions

1.0: Initial version.
1.1, 2021-10-11: Add missing `const` to some constructor declarations.
1.2, 2021-10-25: Tweak some wordings and ambiguities.
1.3, 2021-10-27: Add examples of potential errors in the corresponding class declaration.
1.4, 2021-10-28: Say that it's an error to refer to generative constructors, and make the `Enum` constructor public.
